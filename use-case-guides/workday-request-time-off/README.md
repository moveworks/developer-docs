### Take Time Off with your Copilot üèùÔ∏è

Your employee deserve to take time off to recharge and be productive, and time off request surfaces in Workday don't make this process easy.

By following this guide, you will have a plugin experience that lets your employees take time off with ease, and ensures your managers and payroll teams have accurate records of time off requests to process for team capacity planning.
<!-- 
However traditional processes can discourage timely requests and affect time record accuracy, since it is cumbersome for employees to sign into your single-sign on provider, sign into workday, navigating to your employee schedule calendar, and selecting the appropriate time off plans and dates. Without an accurate record of when employees plan to be off, managers can also be left in the dark, making it nearly impossible to manage team resources effectively. This can lead to understaffing or scheduling conflicts that impact both productivity and morale. 

Inaccurate records of employee time off directly influence payroll accuracy. If the payroll team doesn't have precise information, employees may receive incorrect payments for their time off‚Äîresulting in dissatisfaction and potential legal complications.

By providing a direct and intuitive way for employees to submit time off requests through their Moveworks bot, businesses remove significant barriers to submitting these requests. This user-friendly interaction not only enhances the employee experience but also encourages adherence to formal request procedures. Employees can quickly navigate through the time-off request process without the need to log into multiple systems or navigate complex menus, making it more likely they will follow company policy and timelines for requests.  -->


Let's dive in!

**Pre-requisites**:

1. You have synchronized your employees‚Äô work email from your IDAM like **Okta** or **Microsoft Entra** to Moveworks using Moveworks Setup ([link](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ingest-users))
2. Your workday instance uses the same work email as your IDAM.
3. You have reviewed the [how to implement a Creator Studio guide with your team](https://developer.moveworks.com/creator-studio/program-management/planning/#how-to-implement-a-creator-studio-guide), and have allocated bandwidth for your team to build the plugin.

<!-- **Ease of Building**:

This is a `intermediate` difficulty use case

This will take `2 weeks` for your developer and the business system manager to build, test, and launch. -->

<!-- **Business Value**:

1. Employees need to file time off requests promptly for accurate record keeping
2. However, it is painful for employees to signing into your single-sign on provider, signing into workday, navigating to your employee schedule calendar, and selecting the appropriate time off plans and dates
3. If managers don‚Äôt have accurate record of when employees are off, they can‚Äôt manage
4. If payroll team does not have accurate records, they will not pay employees properly for time off.
5. This plugin provides a convenient way for your employees to submit time off requests. -->


<!-- **SKU Eligibility**: `Core Copilot` SKU (all customers). -->

## Discovery Questions to Personalize Your Conversation  Design *(Customization Options)*

1. Which time off plans should be shown to employees in a given country (that you are launching to)?
    * This determines the expected list of time off plans that will be shown to employees in the conversation design, as well as launch rules for your plugin.
2. Do you want your employees to request time off in Workday, or through your Moveworks copilot?
    * You can simplify development of your plugin by linking your employees to workday to request time off [(example conversation design)](https://developer.moveworks.com/creator-studio/developer-tools/purple-chat-builder/?workspace=%7B%22title%22%3A%22My+Workspace%22%2C%22botSettings%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22mocks%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A6521%2C%22title%22%3A%22Mock+1%22%2C%22transcript%22%3A%7B%22settings%22%3A%7B%22colorStyle%22%3A%22LIGHT%22%2C%22startTime%22%3A%2211%3A43+AM%22%2C%22defaultPerson%22%3A%22GWEN%22%2C%22editable%22%3Atrue%7D%2C%22messages%22%3A%5B%7B%22from%22%3A%22USER%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EI+need+to+take+time+off%2C+could+you+help+me+with+that%3F%3C%2Fp%3E%22%7D%2C%7B%22from%22%3A%22ANNOTATION%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22%3Cp%3E%E2%9C%A8+%3Cb%3ETriggers%3C%2Fb%3E%3A+Natural+Language%3Cbr%3E%3Cbr%3E%3Cb%3E%F0%9F%8F%83%E2%80%8D%E2%99%82%EF%B8%8F+Action%3C%2Fb%3E%3A%3Cb%3E+%3C%2Fb%3EQuery+time+off+details+for+employee%3Cbr%3E%3Cbr%3E%3Ci%3ECalls+plugin+to+lookup+eligible+time+off+balances%3C%2Fi%3E%3C%2Fp%3E%22%7D%2C%7B%22from%22%3A%22BOT%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22%3Cp%3E%E2%9C%85+Calling+plugin+%3Cb%3ERequest+Time+Off%3Cbr%3E%3C%2Fb%3E%E2%9C%85+Fetching+%3Cb%3EWorkday+ID%3C%2Fb%3E%3Cbr%3E%E2%9C%85+Executing+action+%3Cb%3ERequest+Time+Off%3C%2Fb%3E+%3Cbr%3E%F0%9F%94%81+Summarizing+response%3C%2Fp%3E%22%7D%2C%7B%22from%22%3A%22BOT%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22%3Cp%3ESounds+good%2C+which+time+off+plan+would+you+like+to+select%3F%3C%2Fp%3E%22%2C%22cards%22%3A%5B%7B%22title%22%3A%22%3Cp%3E1%3A+Employee+Time+Off+%28USA%29%3C%2Fp%3E%22%7D%2C%7B%22title%22%3A%22%3Cp%3E2%3A+Sick+Time+Off+%28USA%29%3C%2Fp%3E%22%7D%2C%7B%22title%22%3A%22%3Cp%3E3%3A+Wellness+Day+%28USA%29%3C%2Fp%3E%22%7D%2C%7B%22buttons%22%3A%5B%7B%22style%22%3A%22PRIMARY%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22Request+Time+Off+in+Workday%22%7D%2C%7B%22text%22%3A%22Got+it%2C+thanks%21%22%7D%5D%7D%5D%7D%2C%7B%22from%22%3A%22ANNOTATION%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22%3Cp%3E%3Ci%3EEmployees+log+into+workday+to+request+time+off%3C%2Fi%3E%3C%2Fp%3E%22%7D%5D%7D%7D%5D%7D), but this compromises the user experience for your employees.
3. Do you specify time off in days or hours for these plans?
    * This determines the what slot type will be caputured for time off requests, which affects the validation provided to employees
4. What are the required fields for managers to review time off requests (example: comments, business justification). Which are optional?
    * This affects what questions will be asked to employees by your copilot when they submit a time off request
5. Can your employees request time off requests only for themselves, or also for someone else?
   * Note: this guide only allows employees to request time off for themselves. See API research below to understand how you can customize API research to allow time off requests for other employees


# For Workday Administrators

<!-- This document provides a step-by-step guide designed for Workday Administrators and HR Systems Engineers, detailing the procedures for creating credentials, assigning roles, and configuring workday effectively. It serves as a practical manual to ensure accurate setup and management of technical resources. -->


**Level of Access Requested**:
1. Configure a [Workday connector](https://developer.moveworks.com/creator-studio/resources/authentication-guide?id=workday) with your Workday administrator
2. Provide access to the `Worker Data` and `Time Off` Business Objects. Elaborated in [Domain Permissions](#domain-permissions-required) section


## Overview of the Configuration

We will be accessing Workday through the read-only WQL API and the read + write AbsenceManagement REST API, through a Workday Connector in Moveworks. This requires you to:

1. Create a Connector in Creator Studio ‚Äì¬†[link](https://developer.moveworks.com/creator-studio/resources/authentication-guide?id=workday)
   * Grant the [domain permissions below](#domain-permissions-required) as part of your Integrations Security Systems Group (ISSG)
2. Test required APIs in Postman
3. Build use case in Creator Studio

### Domain Permissions Required

| Workday Web Service | Domain Permissions Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Worker Data Query (WQL) | Get_References, Get_Workers, Get_Eligible_Time_Off_Plans, Get_Time_Off_Balance, Get_Positions | Permissions needed to retrieve worker information, including contact details, position, and time off balances. |
| Time Off Request (ReST) | Put_Time_Off_Request, Get_Workers, Get_Positions | Permissions needed to submit time off requests and retrieve worker and position information. |

![Domain%20Permissions](Plugin%20Template%20Request%20Time-Off%20in%20Workday%20081c4d522bf64bbead3697288dd46047/Screenshot%202024-07-12%20at%2012.49.29‚ÄØPM.png)


> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **You will be creating two ISUs, one in a staging environment, and one in production.**



# For Creator Studio Developers

### Step 1: Create a Connector in Creator Studio

[Follow the authentication guide to create a working Workday connector in Creator Studio](https://developer.moveworks.com/creator-studio/resources/authentication-guide?id=workday)

### **Step 2: Test required APIs with Postman**

**Prerequisite: Install Custom Report in Workday**

Use the custom report definitions below to install the columns and prompt defaults for your custom report

[Worker Details Moveworks Columns.xlsx](Plugin%20Template%20Request%20Time-Off%20in%20Workday%20081c4d522bf64bbead3697288dd46047/Worker_Details_Moveworks_Columns.xlsx)

[Worker Details Moveworks Prompt.xlsx](Plugin%20Template%20Request%20Time-Off%20in%20Workday%20081c4d522bf64bbead3697288dd46047/Worker_Details_Moveworks_Prompt.xlsx)

**Input 1: User Slots**

Assume the following inputs for your subsequent API calls

1. User email: `test@workday.net`

**API 2: Authorization**

Copy-paste this authentication cURL into your Postman Collection for this Use case, substituting any red text with the relevant values from your Workday connector configuration. This helps ensure you are connecting to your workday via the generated access token from this API.

```bash
curl --location 'https://{{domain}}.workday.com/ccx/oauth2/{{instance}}/token' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--user '{{client_id}}:{{client_secret}}' \
--data-urlencode 'grant_type=refresh_token' \
--data-urlencode 'refresh_token={{refresh_token}}'
```

**API 4: Request Time Off in Workday**

Copy-paste the API cURL below to submit the time off request for a user in workday, substituting any red text with the relevant values from connector configuration and the user information from the above API. This submits a time-off request for a user correctly. Please note you need to pass the following details from API 3 as part of the request:

1. The date(s) you are requesting time off for, as a JSON array, where each date follows the `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
2. The `timeOffType_id` from API 3 - which is the ID within the `allEligibleTimeOffsForWorker` field
3. The `position_id` from API 3
4. The `workdayId` from API 3

```bash
curl --location 'https://{{domain}}.workday.com/ccx/api/absenceManagement/v1/{{instance}}/workers/{{worker_id}}/requestTimeOff' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {{access_token}}' \

> ‚úÖ **Inform your Creator Studio developer that they can use your Workday connector to build their use case** üöÄ

### **Step 3: Build in Creator Studio**

We will be building this use case as a query triggered path along with an iPaaS to chain APIs 3 and 4 together in order to submit a time off request for a user. We will be following the P1: Sequential Action Chaining design pattern in your iPaaS to build this use case

### Design Pattern P1: Sequential Action Chaining

![Untitled](Plugin%20Template%20Request%20Time-Off%20in%20Workday%20081c4d522bf64bbead3697288dd46047/Untitled.png)

‚ú®¬†**Triggers**

1. Natural language input to copilot requesting to take time off

**üó£Ô∏è¬†Natural Language Slots**

1. Start Date: when time off starts
2. End Date *(optional)*: when time off ends. By default end date is the same as the start date.
3. Comments *(optional)*: Any relevant context / justification for taking time off
4. Start Time *(optional)*: if taking partial days off, starting time for time off can be specified.
5. End Time *(optional)*: if taking partial days off, ending time for time off can be specified.

ü§≤¬†**Inferred Slots**

1. Current Date: used in the "as of date" in the request PTO action. Could be static.
2. Email Address: inferred from user roster profile of the employee calling this plugin

<!-- **üó∫Ô∏è¬†Resolvers**

1. Time Off Plan: maps an employee‚Äôs time off plans to the corresponding time off types (which is required by the request time off API) -->

**üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è¬†Actions**

1. Lookup time off type details: Executes the `/api/wql/v1/{{instance}}/data` API to query the requesting employee's workday ID, eligible time off plans, and relevant time off types through their work email address.
2. Request time off: Executes the `/api/absenceManagement/v1/{{instance}}/workers/{{worker_id}}/requestTimeOff` API to request time off

<!-- **üìö¬†Guidelines**

1. (before this plugin): Employee looks up available time off balance for a particular date, specifies which time off plan they want to use for time off. 
2. Employee specifies the start date for time off, and optionally the end date, comments, start / end times to their copilot
3. The time off request is submitted to the employee's manager for approval -->

**‚ö†Ô∏è¬†Caveats**

1. Assuming an employees select a time off plan that has adequate time off balance. An error message is thrown for an invalid time off 
2. An employee could specify a time off plan that they are not eligible for
