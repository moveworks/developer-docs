# Take Time Off in Workday with your Copilot üèùÔ∏è

Your employees deserve to take time off to recharge and be productive. Requesting time off in Workday requires you to login in and navigate multiple screens.

This guide helps you build a conversational experience for easy time off requests for your employees. It ensures your managers and payroll teams have and accurate records of time off requests.

Let's dive in!

**Pre-requisites**:

1. You have synchronized your employees‚Äô work email from your IDAM like **Okta** or **Microsoft Entra** to Moveworks ([using Moveworks Setup](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ingest-users)).
2. Your Workday instance uses the same work email as your IDAM.
3. You have reviewed the [how to implement a Creator Studio guide with your team](https://developer.moveworks.com/creator-studio/program-management/planning/#how-to-implement-a-creator-studio-guide), and have allocated bandwidth for your team to build the plugin.
4. Your Workday administrator has the necessary permissions to configure an API Client for Workday, and provide access to the `Worker Data` and `Time Off` Business Objects as part of domain security policies. Elaborated in [Domain Permissions](#domain-permissions-required) section

## Discovery Questions to Personalize Your Conversation Design

1. Which time off plans should be shown to employees in a given team or given country (that you are launching to)?
    * This determines the expected list of time off plans that will be shown to employees in the conversation design.
    * This also determines the launch rules for your plugin.
2. Do you want your employees to request time off in Workday, or through your Moveworks copilot?
    * You can simplify development of your plugin by linking your employees to Workday to request time off [(example conversation design)](https://developer.moveworks.com/creator-studio/developer-tools/purple-chat-builder/?workspace=%7B%22title%22%3A%22My+Workspace%22%2C%22botSettings%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22mocks%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A6521%2C%22title%22%3A%22Request+Time+Off%22%2C%22transcript%22%3A%7B%22settings%22%3A%7B%22colorStyle%22%3A%22LIGHT%22%2C%22startTime%22%3A%2211%3A43+AM%22%2C%22defaultPerson%22%3A%22GWEN%22%2C%22editable%22%3Atrue%7D%2C%22messages%22%3A%5B%7B%22from%22%3A%22USER%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EI+need+to+take+time+off%2C+could+you+help+me+with+that%3F%3C%2Fp%3E%22%7D%2C%7B%22from%22%3A%22BOT%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22%3Cp%3E%E2%9C%85+Working+on+%3Cb%3ERequest+Time+Off%3Cbr%3E%3C%2Fb%3E%E2%9C%85+Calling+Plugin+%3Cb%3ERequest+Time+Off%3Cbr%3E%3C%2Fb%3E%E2%8F%B3+Summarizing+response...%3C%2Fp%3E%22%7D%2C%7B%22from%22%3A%22BOT%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22%3Cp%3ESounds+good%2C+you+are+eligible+for+three+time+off+plans%3A%3Cbr%3E1.+Employee+Time+Off+%28USA%29%3Cbr%3E2.+Sick+Time+Off+%28USA%29%3Cbr%3E3.+Wellness+Day+%28USA%29%3Cbr%3E%3Cbr%3EYou+can+request+time+off+through+this+%3Ca+href%3D%5C%22https%3A%2F%2Fworkday.com%5C%22%3Elink%3C%2Fa%3E+here.%3C%2Fp%3E%22%7D%2C%7B%22from%22%3A%22ANNOTATION%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22%3Cp%3E%3Ci%3ELink+redirects+to+Workday.+Employee+log+into+workday+to+request+time+off%3C%2Fi%3E%3C%2Fp%3E%22%7D%5D%7D%7D%5D%7D). However, this compromises the user experience for your employees.
3. What are the required fields for managers to review time off requests (example: comments, business justification). Which are optional?
    * This affects what questions will be asked to employees when they submit a time off request
4. Can your employees request time off requests only for themselves, or also for someone else?
   * Note: this guide only allows employees to request time off for themselves.
   * See API research below to understand how you can customize API research to allow time off requests for other employees

# For Workday Administrators

## Overview of the Configuration

We will be accessing Workday through 
* the read-only WQL API
* the read + write AbsenceManagement REST API
* through your iPaaS connector in Moveworks Creator Studio

This requires you to:

1. Integrate Workday with Creator Studio ‚Äì¬†by following [this guide](https://developer.moveworks.com/creator-studio/resources/authentication-guide?id=workday). After following this guide, you will have
    * An API Client for Workday
    * An Integration System User (ISU)
    * An Integration System Security Group (ISSG)
    * Relevant [domain security policies listed below](#domain-permissions-required) as part of your Integrations Security Systems Group (ISSG)

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Depending on your development practices, you may create multiple ISUs and ISSGs, for each Workday environment.**


2. Install the Custom Report below in Workday

    Use the custom report definitions below to install the columns and prompt defaults for your custom report. This sets up calculated fields for the time off request and time off balance which are required for the plugin to work.

    [Worker Details Moveworks Columns.xlsx](./Plugin%20Template%20Request%20Time-Off%20in%20Workday%20081c4d522bf64bbead3697288dd46047/Worker_Details_Moveworks_Columns.xlsx)

    [Worker Details Moveworks Prompt.xlsx](./Plugin%20Template%20Request%20Time-Off%20in%20Workday%20081c4d522bf64bbead3697288dd46047/Worker_Details_Moveworks_Prompt.xlsx)

3. Share your Workday connector credentials with your Moveworks developer team.

## Domain Permissions Required

| Workday Web Service | Domain Permissions Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Worker Data Query (WQL) | Get_References, Get_Workers, Get_Eligible_Time_Off_Plans, Get_Time_Off_Balance, Get_Positions | Permissions needed to retrieve worker information, including contact details, position, and time off balances. |
| Time Off Request (REST) | Put_Time_Off_Request, Get_Workers, Get_Positions | Permissions needed to submit time off requests and retrieve worker and position information. |

![Domain%20Permissions](Plugin%20Template%20Request%20Time-Off%20in%20Workday%20081c4d522bf64bbead3697288dd46047/Screenshot%202024-07-12%20at%2012.49.29‚ÄØPM.png)

**Inform your Creator Studio developer that they can now use your Workday credentials to build their connector and plugin** üöÄ


# For Creator Studio Developers

## Step 1: Test required APIs with Postman

Assume the following inputs for your subsequent API calls. You may need to change these values based on your Workday instance and user you are testing with.

* User email: `test@workday.net`

**API 1: Authentication**

Copy this cURL command into your Postman Collection. Substitute any red text with relevant Workday API credentials. You can use the access token from this API for any subsequent API calls.

```bash
curl --location 'https://{{domain}}.workday.com/ccx/oauth2/{{instance}}/token' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--user '{{client_id}}:{{client_secret}}' \
--data-urlencode 'grant_type=refresh_token' \
--data-urlencode 'refresh_token={{refresh_token}}'
```

**API 2: Get Time Off Plan Details from Workday**

Use the API below to get relevant time off plan details for an employee in workday. Make sure you:
1. Substitute any `{{placeholder text}}` with the relevant values from connector configuration
2. Substitute `test@workday.net` or another test user email with `{{user.email_addr}}` so that the API can fetch the [requesting user's work email address](https://developer.moveworks.com/creator-studio/reference/user-attributes/#accessing-user-attributes).

```bash
curl --location 'https://{{domain}}.workday.com/ccx/api/wql/v1/{{instance}}/data?limit=10&offset=0' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {{access_token}}' \
--data-raw '
    {
        "query": "SELECT workdayID, fullName, email_PrimaryWorkOrPrimaryHome, position, eligibleAndVisibleTimeOffPlansForWorkerAsOfDate, allEligibleTimeOffsForWorker, cf_TimeOffBalanceForPTOAndVacationPlans FROM workerFromEmailAddress (emailAddress = 'test@workday.net')"
    }
'
```

**API 3: Request Time Off in Workday**

Use the API below to submit the time off request for a user in Workday. Make sure you substitute any `{{placeholder text}}` with the relevant values from previous API. You must pass the following details from API 2 as part of the request:

1. The date(s) you are requesting time off for, as a JSON array, where each date follows the `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
2. The `timeOffType_id` from API 2 - which is the ID within the `allEligibleTimeOffsForWorker` field
2. The `position_id` from API 2
4. The `workdayId` from API 2

```bash
curl --location 'https://{{domain}}.workday.com/ccx/api/absenceManagement/v1/{{instance}}/workers/{{worker_id}}/requestTimeOff' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {{access_token}}' \
--data '{

Automation tools like [Azure Function Apps](https://developer.moveworks.com/creator-studio/resources/authentication-guide?id=azure-function-app), [Workato](https://developer.moveworks.com/creator-studio/resources/authentication-guide?id=workato), and [Power Automate](https://powerusers.microsoft.com/t5/Building-Power-Apps/Formatting-a-JSON-response-from-Power-Automate-flow-on-PowerApps/td-p/907563) allow you to expose REST APIs for use by cloud based applications like Creator Studio.

You can also learn more about these iPaaS / APIM tools in our [Program Management docs](https://developer.moveworks.com/creator-studio/program-management/automation-tools/). By the end of this step, you should have a connector in Creator Studio that allows you to call the new APIs above that you will be building. You may have already completed this step if you have connected to your middleware with Creator Studio.

## Step 3: Write your Orchestration Code in your iPaaS

Here is an example of the code you can use to orchestrate the API calls to submit time off requests in Workday. It is deployed as a Python FastAPI application in a virtual server on Azure App Service. You can modify this code to work with your middleware.

### Example iPaaS Code (with Python and FastAPI)

```python
import os
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from typing import List, Optional
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, Path, Response
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from pydantic import BaseModel
import requests
import httpx
import logging
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Initialize FastAPI application
app = FastAPI()

# Initialize logger
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
console_handler = logging.StreamHandler()
console_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
formatter = logging.Formatter(
    "%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s"
)
console_handler.setFormatter(formatter)
logger.addHandler(console_handler)

# Configuration constants
AUTH_URL = (
    "https://wd2-impl-services1.workday.com/ccx/oauth2/{workday_instance_id}/token"

## Step 4: Build in Creator Studio

We will be building this plugin as a Query-Triggered Path along with an iPaaS to chain APIs 1, 2, and 3 together in order to submit a time off request for a user.

### Plugin Architecture Diagram

![Untitled](./Plugin%20Template%20Request%20Time-Off%20in%20Workday%20081c4d522bf64bbead3697288dd46047/Untitled.png)

**Triggers**

1. Natural language input to copilot requesting to take time off

**Natural Language Slots**

1. Start Date: when time off starts. Configured as a Date Slot.
2. End Date *(optional)*: when time off ends. By default end date is the same as the start date if the user does not specify an end date. Configured as a Date Slot.
3. Comments *(optional)*: Any relevant context / justification for taking time off. Configured as a Free Text Slot.

**Actions**

1. Lookup time off type details: Executes the `/api/wql/v1/{{instance}}/data` API to query the requesting employee's Workday ID, eligible time off plans, and relevant time off types through their work email address.
2. Request time off: Executes the `/api/absenceManagement/v1/{{instance}}/workers/{{worker_id}}/requestTimeOff` API to request time off

**Caveats**

1. If an employee selects a time off plan without adequate time balance, they will get an error message for attempting to request time off from the REST API.
2. Email Address: we assume that a user is only requesting time off for themselves, and use the `{{user.email_addr}}` value from user roster profile of the employee calling this plugin. This would need to be changed if an employee is requesting time off on behalf of another employee.
3. This guide only describes how employees can request time off. It does not notify employees when their time off request is approved through the bot.
    * To add notifications once time off requests are approved, please build a new plugin with the [Events API](https://developer.moveworks.com/creator-studio/quickstart/events/)

### Build Plugin in Creator Studio
1. Click on "Experimental Features" on the top right corner of your Creator Studio window, and ensure Paths in Copilot and Next-gen API editor are enabled. Click "Submit" to get access to necessary features.

    ![Experimental Features](./Plugin%20Template%20Request%20Time-Off%20in%20Workday%20081c4d522bf64bbead3697288dd46047/crest-alt-1.png)

2. Create a Query in Creator Studio. You can copy the plugin details below
    * Plugin Name: `üèùÔ∏è Request Time Off in Workday` 
    * Plugin Description: `Allow employees to submit time off requests in Workday`

    ![Name and Description](./Plugin%20Template%20Request%20Time-Off%20in%20Workday%20081c4d522bf64bbead3697288dd46047/crest-1.png)

3. On the API Connection Screen, Click "Import CURL" to import a cURL command of the `GET /workers/{email}/time-off` API from your middeware tool. You can configure additional authorization headers as per your organization's security policies.

    ```bash
    curl --location 'https//{{base_url}}/workers/{{user.email_addr}}/time-off' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
    ```

    ![API Connection](./Plugin%20Template%20Request%20Time-Off%20in%20Workday%20081c4d522bf64bbead3697288dd46047/crest-alt-2.png)



4. Test your `GET /workers/{email}/time-off` API to make sure it returns your employee's time off details as expected. You can configure the API for one employee only for testing purposes (like `user@workday.net` in the example below), and replace with the requester's email address before launching to production (with `{{user.email_addr}}`).

    ![Test API](./Plugin%20Template%20Request%20Time-Off%20in%20Workday%20081c4d522bf64bbead3697288dd46047/crest-alt-3.png)

5. Save your connector after testing your API.

6. Label your APIs with fields that you want to extract from the response. Set your identifier and description as your Time Off Type and Name. Click Next.

    ![Label APIs](./Plugin%20Template%20Request%20Time-Off%20in%20Workday%20081c4d522bf64bbead3697288dd46047/crest-alt-4.png)

7. Add a Followup Action to Book Time Off.

    * Type: `Ask clarifying questions and execute a solution`
    * Name: `Book Time Off`

    ![Add Followup Action](./Plugin%20Template%20Request%20Time-Off%20in%20Workday%20081c4d522bf64bbead3697288dd46047/crest-alt-5.png)

8. Inside the "Design Conversation" step, ask what the starting date for your employee's time off request.
    * This will be configured as a Date Slot inside Creator Studio

    ![Select Date](./Plugin%20Template%20Request%20Time-Off%20in%20Workday%20081c4d522bf64bbead3697288dd46047/crest-3.png)

9. Ask if the employee wants to specify an end date and additional comments for their time off request.
    *  If employee selects no, they will only take time off for a single busines day (8 hours). This is configurable in your iPaaS.

    ![Select Other Options](./Plugin%20Template%20Request%20Time-Off%20in%20Workday%20081c4d522bf64bbead3697288dd46047/crest-4.png)

10. If your employee selects no, you can configure an API action to submit your time off request.If you use the iPaaS code below, configure your API action as follows:
    * Connector: Use your iPaaS connector here
    * API Endpoint Path: `/workers/{{user.email_addr}}/time-off`
    * Method: `POST`
    * Headers: `Content-Type` : `application/json`
    * Query Params: Leave Blank
    * Request Body: Use the below JSON to configure your API action. The time off type id can be found from running **API 2** for an employee's email.
    ```json
    {
        "start_date": "{{start_date}}",
        "time_off_type_id": "abc1234"
    }
    ```

    ![Submit Time Off](./Plugin%20Template%20Request%20Time-Off%20in%20Workday%20081c4d522bf64bbead3697288dd46047/crest-5.png)

11. If your employee selects yes, ask for the end date and additional comments for their time off request.
    * End Date: this is configured as a Date slot
    * Comments: this is configured as a Free Text input

    ![Select Other Options](./Plugin%20Template%20Request%20Time-Off%20in%20Workday%20081c4d522bf64bbead3697288dd46047/crest-6.png)

12. Configure an API action to submit your time off request if your employee selects yes.
    * If you use the iPaaS code below, configure your API action as follows:
    * Connector: Use your iPaaS connector here
    * API Endpoint Path: `/workers/{{user.email_addr}}/time-off`
    * Method: `POST`
    * Headers: `Content-Type` : `application/json`
    * Query Params: Leave Blank
    * Request Body: Use the below JSON to configure your API action. The time off type id can be found from running **API 2** for an employee's email.
    ```json
    {
        "start_date": "{{start_date}}",
        "time_off_type_id": "abc1234",
        "end_date": "{{end_date}}",
        "comment": "{{comments}}"
    }
    ```
