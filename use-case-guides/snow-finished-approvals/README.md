Based on the needs of this use case, we will be building an **Information Updates** design pattern.

## Creator Studio Components

‚ú®¬†**Triggers:**

1. Scheduled ServiceNow Flow Designer job.

üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Actions:**

1. Call to action to action on approval request.

## API Research

### API #1: Events API

In our quest to automate approval reminders efficiently, the heart of our implementation strategy will be the ServiceNow Flow Designer, specifically tasked with triggering the Moveworks Events API through the Moveworks Send Message Action.

![Untitled](Use%20Case%20Tutorial%20ServiceNow%20Approval%20Reminders%20a8e075be60c94c77b1e4da9ac249d5ce/Untitled.png)

The architectural flow is devised as follows:

1. Start when an approval record is closed
2. If not closed in Moveworks, send a message informing the user

This process uses triggers, conditions, and timed actions with the Moveworks API to send timely reminders and reduce user frustration.

# Steps

## Step 1: Build the ServiceNow Flow

### Install Moveworks SDK for ServiceNow

1. [Download our Moveworks Events Update Set For ServiceNow](https://developer.moveworks.com/file-hosting/servicenow/moveworks.events.1.0.0.xml)
2. Head to the Flow Designer tool on ServiceNow‚Äôs sidebar

![Untitled](Use%20Case%20Tutorial%20ServiceNow%20Approval%20Reminders%20a8e075be60c94c77b1e4da9ac249d5ce/Untitled%201.png)

### Set up ServiceNow Flow

1. In the Flow Designer, create a new **Flow**
    1. Please name the Flow as you like, we will name it *Moveworks Approval Removal*

        ![Untitled](Use%20Case%20Tutorial%20ServiceNow%20Approval%20Reminders%20a8e075be60c94c77b1e4da9ac249d5ce/Untitled%202.png)

2. For the **Trigger:**
    1. Set the Trigger field to **Updated**
    2. Set the Table field to the **Approval [sysapproval_approver]** table
    3. Set four OR conditions for **State is Approved, State is Rejected, State is Cancelled, State is No Longer Required**

        ![Untitled](Use%20Case%20Tutorial%20ServiceNow%20Approval%20Reminders%20a8e075be60c94c77b1e4da9ac249d5ce/Untitled%203.png)

3. To set up the **Actions** by adding a **Moveworks Send Message** Action
    1. Set up the recipient
        1. The recipient will be the approval record approver‚Äôs email
        2. Setup the message you would like to send the approver

            ```html
            Request <ahref="https://{servicenow-instance}.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=sysapproval_approver.do?sysparm_query=sysapproval.number=RITM0123456^approver={user.sys_id}"> was already approved. No further action necessary.

5. Your Flow should look like this:

    ![Untitled](Use%20Case%20Tutorial%20ServiceNow%20Approval%20Reminders%20a8e075be60c94c77b1e4da9ac249d5ce/Untitled%209.png)

## Step 2: See it in action

An event will be sent to the user once the job is triggered and the approval record meets the conditions!
