# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will explore how to use Creator Studio with ServiceNow to send our a CSAT Survey notification when tickets are resolved. 

Let's get started!

# Prerequisites

- Access to create Business Rules in ServiceNow
- `HappyLinkCreator()` function available in ServiceNow as part of your [Happy Signals ServiceNow package](https://support.happysignals.com/technical-guides#servicenow).

The entirety of the text can be customized based on your business requirements.

## Creator Studio Components

    * Customize the notification text by accessing the Purple Chat Mock > clicking on the chat bubble to edit the text.
    ![Purple Chat Editing Image](./ServiceNow%20Happy%20Signals%20CSAT%20Survey/image.png)

2. Which employees / tickets should receive these notifications? E.g: Do you want to exclude executives/VIP users?
    * This is configured in the [launch rules](https://developer.moveworks.com/creator-studio/reference/rules/) for your plugin.

3. Do you want to resolve on all tickets or a subset of tickets?
    * This determines the triggering condition configured in your Servicenow Business Rule.

# Steps

## Step 1: Configure the Moveworks SDK to send Messages via Events API

Note: Be sure to replace [`https://api.am-eu-central.moveworks.ai`](https://api.am-eu-central.moveworks.ai) with the relevant URL for your Moveworks environment.

| Data Center | Moveworks API Base URL |
| --- | --- |
| US - Standard | http://my.moveworks.com  |
| GovCloud | http://my.moveworksgov.com |
| EU | http://my.am-eu-central.moveworks.com/ |
| Canada | http://my.am-ca-central.moveworks.com/ |
| Australia | https://www.notion.so/My-Moveworks-Customer-Enablement-Plan-eac66a80c5784990b866869e51042475?pvs=21 |

```jsx
var MoveworksApiSdk = Class.create();
 
MoveworksApiSdk.prototype = {
 
	initialize: function () {
    	this.baseUrl = "https://api.moveworks.com"
	},
 
	request: function (method, path, body) {
    	var req = new sn_ws.RESTMessageV2();
    	req.setHttpMethod(method);
    	req.setEndpoint(this.baseUrl + path);
        req.setRequestHeader("Authorization", "Bearer " +     gs.getProperty('moveworks.api.bearer_auth_token'));
        req.setRequestBody(JSON.stringify(body));
    	req.setHttpTimeout(60000);
    	response = req.execute();
    	return response;
	},
 
	send_message: function (recipients, msg, event_id) {
    	return this.request("post", "/rest/v1/events/" + event_id + "/messages/send", {
        	"recipients": recipients,
        	"message": msg
    	});
	},
 
	type: 'MoveworksApiSdk'
};

```

## Step 2: In Moveworks Creator Studio, create the API Key and an Event for this Notification

![Create Events Image](./ServiceNow%20Happy%20Signals%20CSAT%20Survey/events-image.png)

Be sure to note down the Event ID, as you will need that in subsequent steps.

## Step 3: Test Events API in Postman / API teste

Test your Events API credentials in an API client like Postman or our [Events API tester](https://developer.moveworks.com/creator-studio/quickstart/events/#step-2-send-a-message)

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.moveworks.ai/rest/v1/events/{{event_id}}/messages/send' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {{event_api_key}}' \
--header 'Content-Type: text/plain' \
--data-raw '{
    "message": "This is an example of Events API messages working in next-gen copilot üî•",
    "recipients": [
      "your_email@example.com"
    ]
}'
```

## Step 4: Configure the Business Rule in ServiceNow

1. Configure ‚ÄúWhen to run‚Äù. To start off, you can select when the ‚Äúincident state changes to Resolved‚Äù.
    * Note: You can customized this step based on your business requirements. For example, if you have custom states, you would select that instead of `Resolved` . Additionally, if you do not want to run on every ticket, you can add more conditions to the filter query.
    
    ![Business Rule Configuration Page](./ServiceNow%20Happy%20Signals%20CSAT%20Survey/business-rule-1.png)

1. On the Advanced tab, add the following code.

    ![Business Rule Configuration Page 2](./ServiceNow%20Happy%20Signals%20CSAT%20Survey/business-rule-2.png)

**Code:**

```jsx
(function executeRule(current, previous /*null when async*/) {

var happyLinkCreator = new x_pgo_happysignals.HappyLinkCreator();

var url = happyLinkCreator.createLink(current);

var message = 'Your case "' + current.number + ' - ' + current.short_description + '" has been resolved with the following notes:<br>Please click <a href="'+ url + '">here</a> to <b>accept the resolution</b> and rate your experience.<br>If your issue was not resolved, please reopen the ticket!';

var event_id="REPLACE_ME";

var moveworksAPI = new MoveworksApiSdk();

moveworksAPI.send_message([current.caller_id.email.toString()], message, event_id);

})(current, previous);
```

üöß¬†Note: replace `event_id` with your event id from Step 2 above.

# Congratulations!

You have just added CSAT to your ServiceNow tickets when they get resolved. Look forward to getting a higher rate of CSAT submissions from your employees.

**The final experience will look something like:**
