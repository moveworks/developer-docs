## **Introduction**

The **“Calculate Average Tenure”** plugin helps users determine the average tenure of employees in a specific department—directly through the Moveworks AI Assistant. By fetching employee data for the selected organization and calculating the average length of service, the plugin provides quick and accurate tenure insights without manual effort. This data-driven approach supports HR teams in workforce analysis, strategic planning, and understanding employee retention trends.

This guide will walk you through setting up and customizing the plugin in Agent Studio in just a few minutes. Let’s get started!

## **Installation Steps**

We recommend creating the connector for **Workday** first, prior to installing this plugin. Please follow the  [Workday Connector](https://marketplace.moveworks.com/connectors/workday?hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) guide to set up the connector.

Specifically, ensure the following domain permissions are assigned with both **View** and **Get** access:

- Worker Tenure Information

**Tenant Configuration:**

All Workday API endpoints in this plugin use `{{TENANT}}` as a placeholder. After installation, replace `{{TENANT}}` in the action definitions with your actual Workday tenant name.

To find your tenant name:

- Log into Workday.
- Check the URL in your browser — the tenant name appears after `workday.com/`, e.g.: [https://impl.workday.com/**your_tenant**/...](https://impl.workday.com/**your_tenant**/...)

Make sure to update this across all actions that reference the Workday API.

### Creation of custom field 'cf_TenureInYears' and its purpose:

This field is created to calculate employee tenure in years for reporting and analysis.

Steps to Create cf_TenureInYears:

- In Workday, search for **Create Calculated Field**.
- For **Business Object**, choose **Worker**.
- Set **Name = TenureInYears**.
- For the **Function**, choose **Date Difference**.
- Set **Parameters:**
    - **Start Date = Hire Date**
    - **End Date = Current Date**
- Click **OK** → **Save**.

After you have configured the connector, Please refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on how to install a plugin in Agent Studio.
