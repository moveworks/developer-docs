# **Introduction**

The **Get Projects in a Team** plugin enables users to find and retrieve all projects assigned to a specific team in Asana. By leveraging Asana’s API, this feature simplifies project management by quickly identifying and listing the relevant projects within a team.

This guide will walk you through adding this functionality to your bot using Creator Studio.

# **Prerequisites**

- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or an API Testing Tool
- [Asana Connector](https://developer.moveworks.com/creator-studio/resources/connector?id=asana) set up in Creator Studio
- [List Teams in a Workspace](https://developer.moveworks.com/creator-studio/resources/plugin/?id=asana-view-teams) Plugin
- An Asana Personal Access Token (PAT)

# **Creator Studio Components**

- **Triggers:**
    1. Natural Language (e.g., "Find projects for the Product Development team")
- **Slots:**
    1. Team GID
- **Actions:**
    1. Get the projects for selected team
        - After user selects the correct team for which they would like

# **API Research**

![Screenshot 2025-03-03 at 4.55.25 PM.png](Get%20a%20list%20of%20my%20projects%2015b588d8909f802e9d68e619f7af092e/Screenshot_2025-03-03_at_4.55.25_PM.png)

## **API #1: Retrieve Projects in a Team**

The [**Get Multiple Projects](https://developers.asana.com/reference/getprojects)** API is used to fetch all projects under a specific team.

**Request:**

```bash
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/projects?workspace=<workspace_gid>&team={{team_gid}}&opt_fields=completed' \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer <Your Asana PAT>'
```

**Path Params:**

- `workspace_gid`: The GID of the workspace, replace `<workspace_gid>` with your Asana workplace GID.
- `team_gid`: The GID of the team whose projects you want to retrieve. This will be an input variable taking on the value from the get teams plugin

**API Response Example:**

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "gid": "111111111",
      "name": "New Feature Development",
      "resource_type": "project"
    },
    {
      "gid": "222222222",
      "name": "Q2 Product Roadmap",
      "resource_type": "project"
    }
  ]
}

```

# **Steps**

## **Step 1: Build HTTP Action**

- Define your API actions for fetching all the tasks:
    1. **Get Projects in Team**
        - Repeat the steps above to create another plugin.
        - **Path**: `/api/1.0/projects`
        - **Method**: GET
        - **Query** **Parameters** :
            - **Key** (workspace) : Value (workspace GID)
            - **Key** (team) : Value ( {{team_gid}} )
                
                ![Screenshot 2025-03-03 at 5.34.16 PM.png](Get%20a%20list%20of%20my%20projects%2015b588d8909f802e9d68e619f7af092e/Screenshot_2025-03-03_at_5.34.16_PM.png)
                
        - **Input Variables** :
            - team_gid: Example Value (**1209453978664838**), data type (string)
                - **Description**: The team_gid is the ID of team we want to check to projects, ALWAYS run "get_team_gid_asana" to get the GID
        - Click on `Test` to check if the Connector setup was successful and expect a successful response as shown below. You will see the request response on the left side and the generated output schema on the right. Click on “GENERATE FROM RESPONSE”
            
            ![Screenshot 2025-03-03 at 5.53.28 PM.png](Get%20a%20list%20of%20my%20projects%2015b588d8909f802e9d68e619f7af092e/Screenshot_2025-03-03_at_5.53.28_PM.png)
            
        - Add the **API Name** and **API Description** as shown below, then click the `Save` button
            
            ![Screenshot 2025-03-03 at 5.55.12 PM.png](Get%20a%20list%20of%20my%20projects%2015b588d8909f802e9d68e619f7af092e/Screenshot_2025-03-03_at_5.55.12_PM.png)
            

## **Step 2:** Build Compound Action

1. **Compound Action 2:** Get projects from team ID
    - Follow the same steps as for the previous compound action
        
        ![Screenshot 2025-03-03 at 6.00.17 PM.png](Get%20a%20list%20of%20my%20projects%2015b588d8909f802e9d68e619f7af092e/Screenshot_2025-03-03_at_6.00.17_PM.png)
        
    - Click on the `Script editor` tab. Here you will be able to build your compound action using the YAML syntax. At a high-level, this syntax provides actions (HTTP Request, APIthon Scripts) and workflow logic (switch statements, for each loops, return statements, parallel, try/catch). See the [Compound Action Syntax](https://developer.moveworks.com/creator-studio/reference/compound_actions_syntax/) Reference for more info.
        
        ```yaml
        steps:
          - action:
              output_key: get_projects_filter_team_asana_result
              action_name: get_projects_filter_team_asana
              input_args:
                team_gid: data.team_gid
          - return:
              output_mapper:
                instructions_for_model: '"ALWAYS run get_team_gid_asana and prompt the user
                  whether their is a team which matches the user query or if multiple
                  teams match the user request ask which team he wants to filter on"'
                list_of_projects: data.get_projects_filter_team_asana_result
        
        ```
        
    - Click on `Input fields` tab and click the `+Add` button. Here you will define the slots that you want to collect from users through the conversation and trigger your Workflow with. After defining the input fields, click the `Submit` button to save your changes.
        
        ![Screenshot 2025-03-03 at 6.01.20 PM.png](Get%20a%20list%20of%20my%20projects%2015b588d8909f802e9d68e619f7af092e/Screenshot_2025-03-03_at_6.01.20_PM.png)
        
    

## Step 3: Build Plugin

- Head over to the `Compound Actions` tab and click on the kebab menu ( `︙` )
- Next, click on `Publish as Plugin`
- First, verify your Plugin **Name** & **Short description** . This is autofilled from the name & description of your compound action.
    
    ![Screenshot 2025-03-03 at 6.18.51 PM.png](Get%20a%20list%20of%20my%20projects%2015b588d8909f802e9d68e619f7af092e/Screenshot_2025-03-03_at_6.18.51_PM.png)
    
- check the User consent required before execution? checkbox. This will ask the user to confirm all of their slot values before executing to plugin and is considered a best practice to enable.
    
    ![Screenshot 2025-03-03 at 6.19.12 PM.png](Get%20a%20list%20of%20my%20projects%2015b588d8909f802e9d68e619f7af092e/Screenshot_2025-03-03_at_6.19.12_PM.png)
    
- Click `Next` and set up your positive and negative triggering examples. This ensures that the bot triggers your plugin given a relevant utterance.
    - See our [guide](https://developer.moveworks.com/creator-studio/conversation-design/triggers/natural-language-triggers/#how-to-write-good-triggering-examples) on Triggering
- Lastly, click `Next` and set the **Launch Rules** you want your plugin to abide by.
    - See our [guide](https://developer.moveworks.com/creator-studio/administration/launch-options/) on Launch Rules

## **Step 4: See it in action!**

- After clicking the final `Submit` button, your plugin will be published to the bot and triggerable based on your **Launch Rules.**
- You should wait up to **5 minutes** after making changes before trying to test in your bot!
- If you run into an issue:
    1. Check our [troubleshooting guides](https://developer.moveworks.com/creator-studio/troubleshooting/support/)
    2. Understand your issue using Logs
    3. Reach out to Support
