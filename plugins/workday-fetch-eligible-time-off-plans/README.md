# Introduction

The **View Eligible Time Off Plans** plugin simplifies this process by allowing users to instantly retrieve their available leave options through a conversational interaction with the Moveworks AI Assistant. By leveraging Workday’s Reports-as-a-Service (RaaS), this plugin ensures employees get real-time access to accurate, personalized time off information — without ever leaving the chat.

This guide will walk you through how to call RaaS from Agent Studio and integrate this plugin into your Moveworks experience.

# Installation Steps

We recommend creating the connector for Workday first, prior to installing this plugin. Please follow the [Workday Connector](https://developer.moveworks.com/creator-studio/resources/connector/?id=workday) guide to create the connector. 

**Note**: For **View Eligible Time Off Plans** functionality, you will need to also add the following permissions (the connector guide will walk you through how to add domain permissions): 

- Assign `Staffing` and `Time Off and Leave` domain permissions with both **View** and **Get** permissions access.

Once the connector is configured, please refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace) for more information on how to install a plugin.
