# Installation Steps

We recommend creating the connector for ServiceNow first, prior to installing this plugin. Please follow the [ServiceNow Connector Guide](https://developer.moveworks.com/creator-studio/resources/connector/?id=servicenow) to create the connector. Note that for Check Software License Inventory, you will need to also add the following permissions:

- **sam_user (Software Asset Management user)** role. More details [here](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/vancouver-it-asset-management/page/product/software-asset-management2/reference/r_SAMRoles.html).

After you have configured the connector, please refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more information on how to install a plugin. 

# Appendix

### **API #1: Table API**

For building this plugin, we’ll be using ServiceNow’s REST APIs, specifically the [Table API](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/xanadu-api-reference/page/integrate/inbound-rest/concept/c_TableAPI.html), which provides methods for accessing and manipulating records in database tables. 

Of the various tables that can be accessed on ServiceNow, for this use case, we are interested in the [alm_license](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/xanadu-it-asset-management/page/product/software-asset-management2/concept/c_SoftwareAssetMgmt.html) table. It helps in the systemic monitoring, assessing, and administering of software licenses, compliance, and optimization. The API provides filtering options as well, which we will be using to extract meaningful data. 

```bash
curl --request GET \
--url 'https://your-domain.service-now.com/api/now/table/alm_license'
--header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'
```
