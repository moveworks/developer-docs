## **Introduction**

The **“Update Bulk Issue Priority”** plugin allows users to efficiently update the priority of multiple Jira issues assigned to them — all at once. Instead of manually editing each ticket, this plugin automates the process, saving time and ensuring that high-priority issues receive the attention they need. 

This guide will walk you through installing and configuring the plugin in **Agent Studio** in just a few minutes. Let’s get started!

## **Prerequisites**

- Access to Agent Studio
