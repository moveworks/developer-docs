## **Installation Steps**

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we recommend setting up the connector in **Agent Studio** beforehand to streamline the process. Please follow our [**SAP SuccessFactors Connector Guide**](https://developer.moveworks.com/creator-studio/resources/connector/?id=sap-success-factors&commit_id=21f2fb0f5f2b0852c62a72235121cd8d78d6b46b;) for detailed instructions. Once completed, proceed to install the **Lookup Direct Reports PTO Balance** plugin and complete the setup efficiently.

For this plugin, ensure the SAP SuccessFactors integration user has the following permissions:

**Required Scopes:**

- `View` access to the **User** entity
- `View` access to the **EmployeeTimeAccountBalance** entity

After configuring the connector, refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on completing the setup.
