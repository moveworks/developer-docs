## **Installation Steps**

We recommend setting up **ServiceNow** before installing this plugin. Please follow the [ServiceNow Connector](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=servicenow&hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) guide to configure the connection.

For this plugin, ensure the user has the following permissions:

- **Table Access**: `Read` access to the `sys_user`, `cmdb_ci_computer` and `cmdb_model`  tables.

Once the connector is successfully configured, follow our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for detailed steps on how to install and activate the plugin in **Agent Studio**.

# **Customization Process**

We are using custom fields for **Last Refresh Date** and **Next Scheduled Refresh**, if you already have them, you can update the action to use your own field. 

Below are the steps you can follow to create a custom field

    - Select: `Configure > Table`
    - This opens the Computer table definition.
3. **Add Custom Fields**
    - Scroll down to the Columns tab at the bottom.
    - Click the New button on the right above the Columns list.
    - A new field (column) form opens.
