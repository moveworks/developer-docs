# **Installation Steps**

We recommend setting up **ServiceNow** before installing this plugin. Please follow the [ServiceNow Connector](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=servicenow&hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) guide to configure the connection.

For this plugin, ensure the user has the following permissions:

- **Table Access**: `Read` access to the `sys_user`, `sys_user_group` and `incident` tables.
- **Field Access:** Sufficient access to retrieve incident details and user group information from ServiceNow.

> Once the connector is successfully configured, follow our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for detailed steps on how to install and activate the plugin in **Agent Studio**.
