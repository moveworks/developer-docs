## Installation Steps

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we recommend setting up the connector in **Agent Studio** beforehand to simplify the process. Please follow the [SAP SuccessFactors Connector](https://developer.moveworks.com/creator-studio/resources/connector/?id=sap-success-factors&commit_id=21f2fb0f5f2b0852c62a72235121cd8d78d6b46b;) Guide to configure the connection.

Note: To enable the Update Personal Email functionality, ensure the SAP SuccessFactors integration user has the necessary permission scopes.

**Required Scopes:**

- `User` – to access user profile data

After configuring the connector, refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on completing the setup.
