# **Installation Steps**

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we recommend creating a connector in Agent Studio beforehand to streamline the process. Please follow our  [SAP Successfactors Connector](https://developer.moveworks.com/creator-studio/resources/connector/?id=sap-success-factors&commit_id=21f2fb0f5f2b0852c62a72235121cd8d78d6b46b;) Guide to do so. Once completed, follow our plugin installation documentation to install the  **Employee Hire Date** plugin in minutes.

After configuring the connector, refer to our installation documentation for more details on completing the setup.

# **Appendix**

## API #1: **Fetch Manager’s UserId using User Email**

The **Employee Hire Date** API retrieves a hireDate using user’s diaplayName.

```bash
curl --request GET
--location 'https://<API_SERVER>/odata/v2/User?%24top=30&%24filter=displayName%20eq%20%27<displayName>%27&%24select=hireDate' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
```

**Path Parameters:**

- `<displayName>` (string) – The displayName of the user whose hire date you want to retrieve. This will provide the hire date of the employee.
