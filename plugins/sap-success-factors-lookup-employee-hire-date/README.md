## **Installation Steps**

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we recommend creating a connector in Agent Studio beforehand to streamline the process. Please follow our  [SAP Successfactors Connector](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=sap-success-factors&hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) Guide to configure the connection.

Note: To enable the Lookup Employee Hire Date functionality, ensure the SAP SuccessFactors integration user has the necessary permission scopes.

**Required Scopes:**

- `View` access to the **employee records** entity

After configuring the connector, refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on completing the setup.

## **Appendix**

### API #1: **Get Hire Date by Email**

The **Employee Hire Date** API retrieves a hireDate using user’s email.

```bash
curl --request GET
--location 'https://<API_SERVER_DOMAIN>/odata/v2/User?%24top=30&%24filter=email%20eq%20%27<email>%27&%24select=hireDate' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
```

**Query Parameters:**

- `<email>` (string) – The email of the user whose hire date you want to retrieve. This will provide the hire date of the employee.
- `$select` (string) – Specifies which properties to return.
