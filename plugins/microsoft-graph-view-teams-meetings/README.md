# Installation Steps

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we do recommend that you create a connector in Agent Studio before installing this plugin to streamline the process. Please follow our **Microsoft Graph Connector Guide** to do so. Once you have done this, simply follow our plugin installation documentation to get your plugin installed in minutes.

**Permissions Needed:**

- `User.Read`
- `User.Read.All`
- `Calendars.Read`
- `Calendars.ReadWrite`
- `CallRecords.Read.All`

# Appendix

- This API call fetches detailed information about a user identified by their email address.
    
    ```bash
    curl -X GET "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/{{email}}" \
         --header "accept: application/json" \
         --header "authorization: Bearer {{personal_access_token}}" \
         --header "content-type: application/json"
    ```
    
    - Required parameters:
        - **`email`**: The email address of the user whose details you want to retrieve. Replace **`{{email}}`** with the actual email address. This email would be obtained from the meta_data of the user using the plugin.
- This API call fetches calendar events for a specified user over a given date range.
    
    ```bash
    curl -X GET "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/{{userid}}/events?$filter=start/dateTime ge '{{from_date}}' and end/dateTime le '{{to_date}}'" \
         --header "accept: application/json" \
         --header "authorization: Bearer {{personal_access_token}}" \
         --header "content-type: application/json"
    ```
    
    - Required parameters:
        - **`userid`**: The unique identifier of the user whose calendar events you wish to retrieve. This is obtained from the result of the previous api.
        - **`from_date`**: The start date-time in **`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`** format (or compatible format for your timezone) to filter events that occur on or after this date.
        - **`to_date`**: The end date-time in **`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`** format (or compatible format for your timezone) to filter events that occur on or before this date.
