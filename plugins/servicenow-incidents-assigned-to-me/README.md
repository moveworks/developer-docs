# **Installation Steps**

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we recommend setting up the connector in **Agent Studio** beforehand to streamline the process. Please refer to our [**ServiceNow Connector Guide**](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=servicenow&hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) for detailed instructions. Once the connector is configured, proceed with the plugin installation to complete the setup efficiently.

For this plugin, ensure the ServiceNow integration user has the following permissions:

- **Read** access to the `incident` table

After configuring the connector, refer to our [**plugin installation documentation**](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for complete setup instructions.
