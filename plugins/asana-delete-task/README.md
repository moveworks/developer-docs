# Installation Steps

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we recommend creating a connector in **Agent Studio** beforehand to streamline the process. Please follow our **Asana Connector Guide** to do so. Once completed, follow our plugin installation documentation to install the **Asana Get Tasks from Project** plugin in minutes.

For **Asana Get Tasks from Project**, you will also need to add the following permissions:

**Required Scopes:**

- `tasks:delete` - To Delete tasks in Asana

After you have configured the connector, please refer to our installation documentation for more information on how to install a plugin.

# Appendix

The [Delete a task](https://developers.asana.com/reference/deletetask) API allows you to delete a task by its GID

```bash
curl --request DELETE \
     --url https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/tasks/{{task_gid}} \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer {{personal_access_token}}'
```

**Path Parameters:**

- `task_gid` (string) – The unique identifier (GID) of the task to be deleted.

This should return an empty object on success.
