# Installation Steps

We recommend creating the connector for **ServiceNow** first before installing this plugin. Please follow the ServiceNow Connector Guide to set up the connector. Note that for the **Update Ticket Fields** plugin, you will need the following permissions (the connector guide will explain how to add them):

- **Write access to the `incident` table**

After you have configured the connector, please refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace) for more information on how to install a plugin.

# Customization Options

- **Only relevant fields should be included in the request body** to optimize API performance.
- **`assigned_to`** should be updated only when explicitly requested.
- **`urgency`**, **`priority`**, and **`state`** should be updated based on direct user input or inferred context.
- **`short_description`** should be changed only if the user requests a modification.

# Appendix

## API Details

The plugin uses the following API to change fields in an incident in ServiceNow:

```bash
curl --request PATCH \
     --url 'https://<instance>.service-now.com/api/now/table/incident/{{task_sys_id}}' \
     --data '{
       "assigned_to": "8971ac838323021014e0c4a6feaad3a2",
       "urgency": "1",
       "priority": "2",
       "state": "2",
       "short_description": "WiFi issue in MTV office"
     }'
```

### Required Path Parameters

- **`task_sys_id`** (string) – Unique identifier of the ticket to be updated.

### Optional Body Parameters (Sent Based on User Input)

- **`assigned_to`** (string) – `user_sys_id` of the assigned user; included only when reassignment is requested.
- **`urgency`** (integer) – Ticket urgency (1 = High, 2 = Medium, 3 = Low); included when specified or inferred.
- **`priority`** (integer) – Ticket priority (1 = Critical, 2 = High, 3 = Moderate, 4 = Low); included if explicitly mentioned or derived from urgency.
- **`state`** (integer) – Ticket status (1 = New, 2 = In Progress, 3 = On Hold, 6 = Resolved, 7 = Closed); included if the user requests a status change.
- **`short_description`** (string) – Updated description of the ticket; included if the user requests a change.
