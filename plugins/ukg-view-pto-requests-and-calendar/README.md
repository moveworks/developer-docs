# Pre-requisites

Before installing and using the **PTO Search** plugin, please ensure the following requirements are met:

## **1. UKG Connector**

This plugin requires an active **UKG connector** and **user consent auth** to communicate with your UKG instance.

- If you have not already configured the connector, please follow the [UKG Connector Guide](https://marketplace.moveworks.com/connectors/ukg) available in the Moveworks Marketplace.
- The connector must be fully set up before installing this plugin.
- Once the connector is successfully configured, follow our [**plugin installation documentation**](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for detailed steps on how to install and activate the plugin in **Agent Studio**.

**Note:** UKG’s user-consent authorization expires every 24 hours, requiring users to reauthorize once per day. This is a known limitation, and support for handling such short-lived refresh tokens is being built on Moveworks.

## **2. UKG System Requirements**

### **End User Permissions (Employee Persona)**

To look up PTO requests through this plugin, employees must already have permission to search PTO records in UKG WFM — the same permissions required to search PTO records through the UKG WFM UI.

At a minimum, end users must have:

- **Time Off permissions** that allow:
    - Viewing available Time Off Types
    - Viewing own Time Off requests
- Access to their own **employee profile and time account balances**

### **End User Permissions (Manager Persona)**

To look up PTO requests through this plugin, managers must already have permission to search PTO records in UKG WFM — the same permissions required to search PTO records through the UKG WFM UI.

At a minimum, end users must have:

- **Time Off permissions** that allow:
    - Viewing available Time Off Types
    - Viewing own Time Off requests
    - Viewing Time Off requests for direct reports
- Access to their own and **direct reports’ employee profile and time account balances**

> Note: The plugin does not grant new permissions. It respects existing role-based permissions and policies granted to the user in UKG WFM.

## API Details

Before running the cURL examples below, replace `<YOUR_UKG_HOST>` with your actual UKG hostname.

**Admin Checklist: How to Find Your UKG Hostname**

1. Log in to your UKG account.
2. Check the URL in your browser’s address bar.
3. Your hostname will follow this format:
    
    Examples:
    
    - `https://acme-dev.cfn.mykronos.com`
    - `https://acme-test.cfn.mykronos.com`
    - `https://acme-uat.cfn.mykronos.com`
    - `https://acme-prod.cfn.mykronos.com`

Use the full hostname (e.g., `acme-prod.cfn.mykronos.com`) when replacing `<YOUR_UKG_HOST>` in the cURL commands.

### **API #1: Get a User’s UKG ID**

This REST API is used to fetch employee details for the current logged in user.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://<YOUR_UKG_HOST>/api/v1/commons/persons/current_user_info?include_contact_information=true' \
  --header 'Authorization: <ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

**Query Parameters:**

- None.

### **API #2: Retrieve User’s available Hyperfind Queries**

This REST API is used to check if the logged in user is a manager in UKG WFM. If the user has the hyperfind query “**My Direct Reports**” in returned list, then the user is a manager.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://<YOUR_UKG_HOST>/api/v1/commons/hyperfind \
  --header 'Authorization: <ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

**Query Parameters:**

- None.

### **API #3: Retrieve User’s List of Direct Reports**

This REST API is used to retrieve the list of direct reports for the logged in user (expected to be a manager).

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://<YOUR_UKG_HOST>/api/v1/commons/hyperfind/execute \
  --header 'Authorization: <ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "dateRange": {
    "symbolicPeriod": {
      "qualifier": "Current_Payperiod"
    }
  },
  "hyperfind": {
    "qualifier": "My Direct Reports"
  }
}'
```

**Query Parameters:**

- None.

### API #4: Retrieve PTO Requests

This API retrieves PTO requests filtered by:

- **Employee list** (array of person IDs)
- **Completion state** (`INCOMPLETE` / `COMPLETE`)
- **Date range**

It is used in the following scenarios:

1. **Scheduled & Past PTO (Employee View)**
    - `ARRAY_OF_PERSON_IDS`: Logged-in user’s person ID (wrapped in an array)
    - `COMPLETION_STATE`: `COMPLETE`
    - Returns approved upcoming and past PTO requests
2. **Pending PTO Requests (Manager View)**
    - `ARRAY_OF_PERSON_IDS`: Direct reports’ person IDs
    - `COMPLETION_STATE`: `INCOMPLETE`
    - Returns pending requests awaiting approval
3. **Team PTO Calendar (Manager View)**
    - `ARRAY_OF_PERSON_IDS`: Direct reports’ person IDs
    - `COMPLETION_STATE`: `COMPLETE`
    - Returns approved PTO requests for the team

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://<YOUR_UKG_HOST>/api/v1/scheduling/timeoff/multi_read \
  --header 'Authorization: <ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "where": {
    "states": {
      "employeeRefs": {
        "ids": <ARRAY_OF_PERSON_IDS>
      },
      "completionState": "<COMPLETION_STATE>",
      "endDate": "<END_DATE>",
      "startDate": "<START_DATE>"
    }
  }
}'
```

**Filter Parameters:**

- `ARRAY_OF_PERSON_IDS` *(string):* This will be a list of direct reports (manager) or just the logged in user’s person ID (employee)
- `COMPLETION_STATE` *(string):* This will be the completion state of the PTO request (INCOMPLETE/COMPLETE).
- `START_DATE` *(string):* This will be the start date to search for PTO requests. If user has not specified a date, it defaults to 3 months prior to the current date.
- `END_DATE` *(string):* This will be the end date to search for PTO requests. If user has not specified a date, it defaults to 3 months after the current date.

**Key nuances:**

- `COMPLETION_STATE` results and filtering:
    - When `COMPLETION_STATE` = “**COMPLETE**” the results returned will include APPROVED, REFUSED and CANCELLED requests and the plugin will filter on APPROVED requests only.

### API References

This plugin use **UKG WFM Pro Time Management REST APIs** to retrieve employee information, determine eligible PTO time types, and check PTO balance.

For detailed information on request parameters, response formats, error handling, and versioning, please refer to the [**official UKG API documentation**](https://developer.ukg.com/wfm/reference/welcome-to-the-ukg-pro-workforce-management-api) provided by UKG.

# **What Is In Scope for This Plugin?**

This plugin supports the following capabilities:

- Searching for PTO requests for **limited leave types** (e.g., Vacation, Sick Leave, Casual Leave, Earned Leave, Comp Time).
- Restricted to PTO requests that are currently pending and require a manager’s approval.
- The plugin is intended to provide visibility only.

# **What Is Out of Scope for This Plugin?**

This plugin does **not** support the following:

- Searching for PTO requests for **non-limited or leave-of-absence types**, such as parental leave, FMLA, or long-term disability.
- The UKG Connector API does not support an employee acting on behalf of a manager (i.e., manager delegation/proxy approver).
- Retrieval of PTO Balances are handled by a separate plugin.
- Approving, rejecting, editing, or cancelling PTO are handled by separate plugins.
- Coverage or capacity analysis (e.g., overlap warnings, staffing impact).
