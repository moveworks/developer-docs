This guide will walk you through setting up and customizing the plugin in Agent Studio in just a few minutes. Let’s get started!

## **Prerequisites**

• Access to **Agent Studio**

## **Installation Steps**

We recommend creating the connector for **Salesforce** first, prior to installing this plugin. Please follow the [Salesforce Connector](https://marketplace.moveworks.com/connectors/salesforce#how-to-implement) guide to set up the connector.

Specifically, confirm the following permissions are granted:

- **Object Access**: `Read` access to the **Lead** object.
- Ensure the user has permission to view lead records relevant to their team or territory.

After you have configured the connector, please refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on how to install a plugin in Agent Studio.
