## **Introduction**

The **“Lookup SLA Breach Report”** plugin helps users track and review issues that have breached SLA targets across different projects. It supports multiple SLA metrics—(e.g., Time to First Response, Time to Resolution, etc.)—and allows for custom date range selection. The report provides key issue details, including summary, status, assignee, and breach time, with the option to view complete information using the issue key.

This guide will walk you through installing and configuring the plugin in **Agent Studio** in just a few minutes. Let’s get started!

## **Installation Steps**

We recommend setting up **Jira** before installing this plugin. Please follow the [Jira Connector](https://marketplace.moveworks.com/connectors/jira?hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) guide to configure the connection.

**Ensure the following permissions are granted:**

- **Admin Access**: Required to configure and retrieve SLA fields.
- **Project Access**: Required to view and manage issues within the Jira project.
- **Field Access**: Required to read fields such as priority and issue key.

**Note:**

This plugin requires a Jira Service Management Premium or Enterprise plan and appropriate permissions to access advanced SLA metrics.

Once the connector is successfully configured, follow our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for detailed steps on how to install and activate the plugin in **Agent Studio**.

## **Customization Process:**

In Jira Service Management, the **SLA field** is visible by default in service projects on a **Premium or higher plan**. If it's not showing, ensure the project uses a service management template, SLA tracking is enabled, and the user is a **Project Admin**.

Please follow the steps below to create the SLA field:

### SLA Fields setup in Jira Service Management

**1. Go to Your Project Settings**

- Navigate to the **Jira Service Management project** where you want to add the SLA.
- Click on **Project settings** (bottom left corner of the project sidebar).



**2.** **Open SLA Configuration**

- In the left-hand sidebar under **Project settings**, click on **SLAs**.



**3.** **Create a New SLA**

- Click the **"Add SLA"** button at the top-right corner.


**4. Define SLA Goal Name**

- Give your SLA a name that clearly reflects its purpose.

**Example**:

- Name: **Time to First Response**



**5. Set Up SLA Start and Stop Conditions**

- These determine **when the SLA timer starts and stops**.

**Example – Time to First Response**:

- **Start counting time**: When **Issue Created**
- **Stop counting time**: When **Comment is added (from an agent)**



**6. Set SLA Goals by Condition**

Define different time goals based on conditions like priority or issue type using **JQL filters** directly in the **SLA configuration panel**.

You’ll find the **"Add goal"** option when creating or editing an SLA. This is where you apply the JQL to specify when each goal should apply.

Where to enter JQL:

- After clicking **Add goal**, you’ll see a **"Set conditions"** field — this is where you enter the **JQL**.

Example JQL:

```
priority = High
priority = Medium
priority = Low
```

Then set the goal:

- **Time goal**: 2h, 4h, 8h

**Summary:**

- JQL is applied in the **Add goal section**.
- Each JQL defines **when a specific SLA time goal applies**.



**7. Set the Calendar (Working Hours)**

This determines **when the SLA clock is active**.

- Select an existing **calendar** or create a new one (e.g., 9am–5pm weekdays).
- This is important to avoid counting weekends/non-working hours.


**8. Save the SLA**

- Click **Save** at the bottom when you’re done setting everything up.

## **Appendix**

### **API #1: Get SLA Field Name**

```bash
curl --location 'https://<YOUR_INSTANCE>/rest/servicedeskapi/request?expand=sla' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic <API_TOKEN>'
```

### **API #2: Get Issues With SLA Breach By Priority**

```bash
curl --location 'https://<YOUR_INSTANCE>/rest/api/3/search?jql=created >= {{create_date}} AND "{{sla_field}}" = breached() AND priority = {{priority}} AND fields= priority,key,summary' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic <API_TOKEN>'
```

**Query Parameter:**

`create_date` : (string) - Filters by issues created in a given time range (e.g., `7d`, `-14d`, etc.)

`sla_field` : (string) - Filters the issue using the SLA fields name (e.g., Time to first response, Time to resolution, etc.)

`priority` : (string) - Filters the issue with their priority (e.g., Highest, Medium, Lowest)

### **API #3: Fetch Issue Details by Key**

```bash
curl --location 'https://<YOUR_INSTANCE>/rest/api/3/issue/{{issue_key}}' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic <API_TOKEN>'
```

**Path Parameter:**

`issue_key`  :(string) - Filters the summary for the specified issue key (e.g.,ISAD-32).
