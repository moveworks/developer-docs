## **Introduction**

The “**Look Up Candidate Application Status”** plugin enables recruiters and hiring managers to easily retrieve and review the application status of candidates. Users can search for candidates by name, email, or job requisition and view key details such as job title, requisition ID, and current application stage. This allows recruiters to quickly check the progress of candidates in the hiring process.

This guide will walk you through installing and configuring the plugin in **Agent Studio** in just a few minutes. Let’s get started!

## **Installation Steps**

We recommend setting up SAP SuccessFactors before installing this plugin. Please follow the [SAP SuccessFactors connector](https://marketplace.moveworks.com/connectors/sap-success-factors#how-to-implement) guide to configure the connection.

The integration user should need the following permission:

- `View` access to the **JobApplication**, **JobRequisition**, and **Candidate** entities.

**Your Instance Configuration**

All SAP SuccessFactors API endpoints in this plugin use **`'YOUR_INSTANCE'`** as a placeholder. After installation, replace **`'YOUR_INSTANCE'`** in the action definitions with your actual SuccessFactors instance name.

To find your instance name:

1. Log in to your SAP SuccessFactors account.
2. Check the URL in your browser — the instance name appears before `.successfactors.com`
    - e.g., [https://corp123.successfactors.com](https://corp123.successfactors.com/) → instance name = **`corp123`**

**API Domain Configuration**

SAP SuccessFactors uses **region-specific API domains**. To ensure your API calls connect to the correct tenant:

1. Identify your instance name (as shown above)
2. Refer to SAP’s official API server list to select the correct regional domain: [**List of SAP SuccessFactors API Servers — OData v2**](https://help.sap.com/docs/successfactors-platform/sap-successfactors-api-reference-guide-odata-v2/list-of-sap-successfactors-api-servers?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
3. Replace **`'YOUR_INSTANCE'`** and use the appropriate API domain based on your region
    - e.g., [https://apicorp123.successfactors.com](https://apicorp123.successfactors.com/)

Note: SAP does not support IP-based endpoints — always use official SAP domain URLs.

Make sure to update this across all actions that reference the SAP SuccessFactors API.

Once the connector is successfully configured, follow our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for detailed steps on how to install and activate the plugin in **Agent Studio**.
