## **Introduction**

The “**Look Up Candidate Application Status”** plugin enables recruiters and hiring managers to easily retrieve and review the application status of candidates. Users can search for candidates by name, email, or job requisition and view key details such as job title, requisition ID, and current application stage. This allows recruiters to quickly check the progress of candidates in the hiring process.

This guide will walk you through installing and configuring the plugin in **Agent Studio** in just a few minutes. Let’s get started!

## **Installation Steps**

We recommend setting up SAP SuccessFactors before installing this plugin. Please follow the [SAP SuccessFactors connector](https://marketplace.moveworks.com/connectors/sap-success-factors#how-to-implement) guide to configure the connection.

The integration user should need the following permission:

- `View` access to the **JobApplication**, **JobRequisition**, and **Candidate** entities.

Once the connector is successfully configured, follow our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for detailed steps on how to install and activate the plugin in **Agent Studio**.

## **Appendix**

### **API #1: Get Job Requisition Id By Recruiter's Email Or Jobtitle**

```bash
curl --location 'https://<YOUR_INSTANCE>/odata/v2/JobRequisition?$expand=recruiter,jobReqLocale&$filter={{filter_query}}&$select=jobReqId,jobReqLocale/jobTitle,recruiter/email&$top=30' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \

```

**Query Parameters :**

- $filter (string) – Filter items by property values
    - You can filter by recruiter email **and** a keyword in the job title. This filtering works dynamically across different properties.
        - Example:
        
        For jobtitle : `substringof('Director', jobReqLocale/jobTitle)` 
        
        For recruiter email : `recruiter/email eq 'Tessa.Walker@bestrunsap.com'` 
        
- $select (array[string]) – Select properties to be returned
    - For job requisitions, you can display properties like `jobReqId`, `jobReqLocale/jobTitle`, etc.
- $expand (string) – Additional fields to include to view related details like `recruiter` .
- **optional_fields** (string) – Specify additional fields to include in the response, such as `$top`
- **Important Note**
    - The **`$expand`** query parameter lets you look up related entities, while **`$select`** is used to display specific fields, including fields from expanded entities.
    - To show additional details from an expanded entity, use the format: `/`
        - Example: `jobReqLocale/jobTitle` selects the `jobTitle` field from the expanded `jobReqLocale` entity.

### **API #2: Get Job Requisition Id By Candidate Name**

```bash
curl --location 'https://<YOUR_INSTANCE>/odata/v2/JobApplication?$filter={{filter_query}}&$select=jobReqId,firstName,lastName' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
```

**Query Parameters :**

- $filter (string) – Filter items by property values
    - You can filter by a partial match of the candidate's name - by either first name or last name of the candidate.
        - Example : `substringof('Marcos', firstName) or substringof('Marcos', lastName)`
        - This returns all job applications where the candidate’s first **or** last name contains “Marcos”.
- $select (array[string]) – Select properties to be returned
    - For job applications, you can display properties like `jobReqId`, `firstName`, `lastName`.
- **Important Note**
    - The **`$filter`** parameter supports `substringof` for partial matches on text fields.

### **API #3: Get Candidate Application Summary**

```bash
curl --location 'https://<YOUR_INSTANCE>/odata/v2/JobApplication({{jobreqid}})?$select=firstName,lastName,candidateId,contactEmail,nonApplicantStatus,lastModifiedDateTime,jobAppStatus/appStatusName,candidate/creationDateTime&$expand=jobAppStatus,candidate' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
```

**Path Parameters :** 

`jobreqid` : (string) - Used to retrieve the candidate’s application summary.
