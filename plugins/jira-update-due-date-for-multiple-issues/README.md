## **Installation Steps:-**

We recommend setting up **Jira** before installing this plugin. Please follow the [**Jira Connector**](https://marketplace.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=jira&hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) guide to configure the connection.

**Ensure the following permissions are granted:**

- **Admin Access**: Required to archive issues using the Jira API
- **Project Access**: Ability to view and manage issues in the target Jira projects
- **Field Access**: Permission to read and update the **Priority**, **Assignee**, and **Resolution Date** fields

**Note:**

- This plugin requires a **Jira Premium or Enterprise plan**, as the issue archive feature is only available in these plans.

Once the connector is successfully configured, follow our [**plugin installation documentation**](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for detailed steps on how to install and activate the plugin in **Agent Studio**.
