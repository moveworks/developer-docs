## **Introduction:-**

The **“Update Status of a Case”** plugin allows users to easily update the status of a ServiceNow case directly through the Moveworks AI Assistant. By providing the case number and selecting a status like In Progress, Resolved, or Closed, users can manage incidents faster without navigating ServiceNow. When marking a case as Resolved or Closed, the plugin also collects required fields like Resolution Code and Resolution Notes.

This guide will walk you through setting up and customizing the plugin in Agent Studio in just a few minutes. Let’s get started!

## **Prerequisites:-**

• Access to **Agent Studio**

## **What are we building?**
