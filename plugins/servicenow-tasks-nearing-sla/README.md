# Installation Steps

We recommend creating the connector for ServiceNow first, prior to installing this plugin. Please follow the [ServiceNow Connector Guide](https://developer.moveworks.com/creator-studio/resources/connector?id=servicenow) to create the connector. Note that for the Lookup Tickets Nearing/Breaching SLA plugin, you will need to also add the following permissions (the connector guide will walk you through how to add permissions):

- Read access to `task_sla` table
- Read access to `incident` table

After you have configured the connector, please refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace) for more information on how to install a plugin.

# Customization Options (optional)

1. Customize the SLA thresholds to filter tickets based on business needs.
2. Modify the response format to include additional ticket details.
