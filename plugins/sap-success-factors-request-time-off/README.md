# **Installation Steps**

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we recommend setting up the connector in **Agent Studio** beforehand to simplify the process. Please follow our [SAP SuccessFactors Connector Guide](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package?id=sap-success-factors&hist=home%2Cbrws) for detailed instructions. Once completed, proceed to install the plugin and complete the setup efficiently.

After configuring the connector, refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on completing the setup
