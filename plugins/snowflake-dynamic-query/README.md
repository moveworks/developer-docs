# Dynamic Queries with Snowflake Cortex Analyst

This plugin allows users to query Snowflake databases using natural language directly through the Moveworks AI Assistant. It leverages **Snowflake Cortex Analyst** to convert questions into SQL, providing instant insights from your semantic model.

With this plugin, users can:

- Ask plain English questions like “What were total Q4 sales?”
- Automatically generate and execute SQL queries using Snowflake Cortex
- View results from your Snowflake warehouse in real-time

This guide will walk you through the installation process in Agent Studio. Let’s get started!

---

## Prerequisites

- Access to **Agent Studio**
- A **semantic model** created in Snowflake (required for natural language interpretation)
    
    → [Follow this tutorial to create your model](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-analyst/tutorials/tutorial-1#introduction)
    
- A **Snowflake account** and **user role** with privileges to:
    - Create database, schema, and table objects
    - Manage a virtual warehouse
    - Access Cortex Analyst APIs

## Installation Steps

We recommend creating the **Snowflake connector** first before installing this plugin.

Please follow the [Snowflake Connector Guide](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package?id=snowflake&hist=home%2Cbrws) to create the connector.

For the **Query Snowflake with Snowflake Cortex Analyst** plugin, ensure the connector includes the following permissions:

- Access to `/api/v2/cortex/analyst/message` and `/api/v2/statements`

Once the connector is configured, continue with the standard plugin installation process in Agent Studio.

Visit our plugin installation documentation →

### API #1: Analyze User Query (Natural Language to SQL)

**Endpoint:**

`POST /api/v2/cortex/analyst/message`

→ Converts user intent to SQL based on the semantic model.

**Docs:**

[Snowflake Cortex Analyst API Docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-analyst/rest-api#send-message)

---

### API #2: Execute SQL

**Endpoint:**

`POST /api/v2/statements`

→ Executes the generated SQL and returns results from Snowflake.
