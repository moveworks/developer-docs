# Installation Steps

We recommend creating the connector for Slack first, prior to installing this plugin. Please follow the [Slack Connector](https://developer.moveworks.com/creator-studio/resources/connector/?id=slack) guide to create the connector.

**Note**: For **Fetch Public Slack Channels** functionality, you will need to also add the following permissions (the connector guide will walk you through how to add permissions): 

- Assign the `channels:read`, `groups:read`, `im:read` and `mpim:read` scopes to the User token that is being used.

Once the connector is configured, please refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace) for more information on how to install a plugin. 

# Appendix

### API #1: **conversations.list**

The [conversations.list](https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.list) API in Slack allows you to retrieve all public channels available in a workspace.
