# Introduction

The Customer Support Performance Report plugin enables your users to retrieve aggregated customer support metrics from ServiceNow directly through the Moveworks AI Assistant.

This guide will help you install this plugin within minutes in Agent Studio. Letâ€™s get started!

# Prerequisites

- Access to Agent Studio
- ServiceNow Connector configured (Refer to the [ServiceNow Connector Guide](https://developer.moveworks.com/creator-studio/resources/connector?id=servicenow))

# Installation Steps

We recommend creating the connector for ServiceNow first, prior to installing this plugin. Please follow the [ServiceNow Connector Guide](https://developer.moveworks.com/creator-studio/resources/connector?id=servicenow) to create the connector. Note that for the Customer Support Performance Report plugin, you will need to also add the following permissions (the connector guide will walk you through how to add permissions):

- **Read access to the `incident` &`task_sla` table in ServiceNow**

After you have configured the connector, please refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace) for more information on how to install a plugin.

# Customization Options

1. Modify query filters to customize reporting timeframes (e.g., last 7 days, last month, etc.).
2. Adjust reporting fields to include additional KPIs if needed.
