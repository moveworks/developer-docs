# Installation Steps

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we do recommend that you create a connector in Agent Studio before installing this plugin to streamline the process. Please follow our Zoom **Connector Guide** to do so. Once you have done this, simply follow our plugin installation documentation to get your plugin installed in minutes.

**Scopes Needed:**

- `meeting:read:past_qa:admin`
- For more information : [https://developers.zoom.us/docs/integrations/oauth-scopes-overview/](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/integrations/oauth-scopes-overview/)

# Appendix

- This API call allows you to retrieve the Q&A sessions from a specific past Zoom meeting.
    
    ```bash
    curl -X GET "https://api.zoom.us/v2/past_meetings/{{meeting_id}}/qa" \
         --header "accept: application/json" \
         --header "authorization: Bearer {{personal_access_token}}" \
         --header "content-type: application/json"
    ```
    
    - Required parameters:
        - **`meeting_id`**: The unique identifier for the past Zoom meeting whose Q&A data you want to retrieve. This parameter needs to be replaced with the actual meeting ID to query its associated Q&A sessions.
