# Installation Steps

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we do recommend that you create a connector in Agent Studio before installing this plugin to streamline the process. Please follow our **Asana Connector Guide** to do so. Once you have done this, simply follow our plugin installation documentation to get your plugin installed in minutes. For **Update Task**, you will also need to add the following permissions:

**Permissions Needed:**

- `tasks:write` – Allows modifying task attributes

After you have configured the connector, please refer to our installation documentation for more information on how to install a plugin.

# Customization Options

1. We can change the body parameters we can let the user change in the current plugin we are allowing the user to update the tasks name, due date, assignee and status. To see what can be update please refer to the API documentation [Update Task](https://developers.asana.com/reference/updatetask).

# Appendix

The [Update Task](https://developers.asana.com/reference/updatetask) API allows modifying task details such as name, due date, assignee, or status.

     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer {personal_access_token}' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data '
{
  "data": {
    "name": "New Task Name",
    "completed": true
  }
}
'
```

**Optional Body Parameters:**

- `name`: The new name for the task.
