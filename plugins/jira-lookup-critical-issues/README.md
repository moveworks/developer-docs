## **Installation Steps**

We recommend setting up **Jira** before installing this plugin. Please follow the [Jira Connector](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=jira&hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) guide to configure the connection.

Ensure the following permissions are granted:

- **Project Access**: Sufficient access to view and manage issues within the desired Jira projects
- **Field Access**: Access to read and update the **Priority** and **Assignee** fields on Jira issues

Once the connector is successfully configured, follow our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for detailed steps on how to install and activate the plugin in **Agent Studio**!
