# Installation Steps

We recommend creating the connector for Greenhouse first, prior to installing this plugin. Please follow the [Greenhouse Connector](https://developer.moveworks.com/creator-studio/resources/connector?id=greenhouse) guide to create the connector.

After you have configured the connector, please refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace) for more information on how to install a plugin. 

# Appendix

### API #1: Fetch User Id

The [List Users](https://developers.greenhouse.io/harvest.html?shell#get-list-users) API in Greenhouse allows you to retrieve details about users within the system. The API response will be used to extract the `user_id`, which will then be used to ensure that candidate applications are only shown for jobs the user has permission to access.

```bash
curl 'https://harvest.greenhouse.io/v1/users?email={{user.email_addr}}'
--user '<api_key>:'
```

**Query Parameters :**

- Key ( **email** ) : Value ( **{{user.email_addr}}** )

### API #2: Fetch Open Jobs

The [List Jobs](https://developers.greenhouse.io/harvest.html?shell#get-list-jobs) API in Greenhouse allows you to retrieve a list of jobs in the system. The `fields` parameter will be used to limit the response to essential details, optimizing data retrieval.

The previously fetched `user_id` will be used to filter only open jobs posted by the recruiter or hiring manager, ensuring that users can easily access and manage the job postings they are responsible for.

```bash
curl 'https://harvest.greenhouse.io/v1/jobs?status=open&updated_after={{updated_after}}'
--user '<api_key>:'
```

### API #3: Fetch Candidate Applications

The [List Applications](https://developers.greenhouse.io/harvest.html?shell#get-list-applications) API in Greenhouse allows you to retrieve all candidate applications for a specific job. The API response will be filtered using the `job_id` parameter to fetch only applications related to the given job. Additionally, the `fields` parameter will be used to limit the response to relevant details, ensuring efficient and structured data retrieval.

```bash
curl 'https://harvest.greenhouse.io/v1/applications?job_id={{job_id}}&last_activity_after={{last_activity_after}}'
--user '<api_key>:'
```

**Query Parameters :**

- Key ( **job_id** ) : Value ( **{{job_id}}** )
- Key ( **last_activity_after** ) : Value ( **{{last_activity_after}}** )
