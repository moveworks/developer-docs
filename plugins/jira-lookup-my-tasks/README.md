## **Installation Steps**

We recommend setting up **Jira** before installing this plugin. Please follow the [Jira Connector](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=jira&hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) guide to configure the connection.

Once the connector is successfully configured, follow our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for detailed steps on how to install and activate the plugin in **Agent Studio**.
