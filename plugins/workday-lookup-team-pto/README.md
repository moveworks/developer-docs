This guide will walk you through installing and configuring the plugin in **Agent Studio** in just a few minutes. Let’s get started!

## **Prerequisites**

## **Installation Steps**

We recommend creating the connector for **Workday** first, before installing this plugin. Please follow the [Workday Connector](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=workday&hist=home%2Cbrws#step-4-add-domain-security-policies-to-the-integration-systems-security-group) guide to set up the connector.

Note: To enable the Look Up Direct Reports PTO Balance functionality, ensure your Workday integration system user has the appropriate domain permissions.

Specifically, the following domain permissions must be granted with both **View** and **Get** access:

- **Absence Management** – to access time off and PTO data
- **Worker Data: Time Off** – to view PTO balances for direct reports

**Tenant Configuration:**

All Workday API endpoints in this plugin use `<TENANT>` as a placeholder. After installation, replace `<TENANT>` in the action definitions with your actual Workday tenant name.

To find your tenant name:

- Log into Workday.
- Check the URL in your browser — the tenant name appears after `workday.com/`, e.g.:[https://impl.workday.com/**your_tenant**/...](https://impl.workday.com/**your_tenant**/...)

Make sure to update this across all actions that reference the Workday API.

After configuring the connector and updating your tenant, refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on completing the setup.
