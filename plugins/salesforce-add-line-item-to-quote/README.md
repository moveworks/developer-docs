## **Installation Steps**

We recommend setting up **Salesforce** before installing this plugin. Please follow the [Salesforce Connector](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=salesforce&hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) guide to configure the connection.

Note: To enable the Add a Line Item to a Quote functionality, ensure the Salesforce integration user has the necessary object and field-level permissions.

Specifically, confirm the following permissions are granted:

- **Object Access**: `Read` and `Create` access to the **QuoteLineItem**, **Quote**, and **PricebookEntry** objects.
- **Field Access**: `Read` and `Edit` access to fields such as **QuoteId**, **PricebookEntryId**, **Quantity**, **UnitPrice**, and any custom fields your organization uses for quote line items.

Once the connector is successfully configured, follow our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for detailed steps on how to install and activate the plugin in **Agent Studio**.
