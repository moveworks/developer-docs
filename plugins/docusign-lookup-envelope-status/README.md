# Installation Steps

We recommend creating the connector for Docusign first, prior to installing this plugin. Please follow the [Docusign Connector Guide](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=docusign#how-to-implement) to create the connector. Note that for **Look up envelope status**, you will also need to add the following permissions:

- DS Sender: More details [here](https://support.docusign.com/s/document-item?language=en_US&_gl=1*1jinp81*_gcl_au*MzM2MjUzNjg0LjE3NDc5ODkzNzguODAxMjkzMTMuMTc0ODI1MTA5Ni4xNzQ4MjUxMTc0&bundleId=pik1583277475390&topicId=pof1583277362435.html&_LANG=enus).

After you have configured the connector, please refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace) for more information on how to install a plugin.
