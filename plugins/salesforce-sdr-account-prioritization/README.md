description: This plugin analyzes an SDR's assigned accounts and ranks them based
  on recent engagement (calls, emails, meetings from Salesloft) only if there's no
  open opportunity in Salesforce. It helps new SDRs decide who to reach out to first
  — driving smarter outreach and faster pipeline generation.
