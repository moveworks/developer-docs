# Installation Steps

We recommend creating the connector for ServiceNow first, prior to installing this plugin. Please follow the [ServiceNow Connector Guide](https://developer.moveworks.com/creator-studio/resources/connector/?id=servicenow) to create the connector. Note that for Look Up a Cost Center ID by its Name, you will need to also add the following permissions:

- read access to the Cost Center table (cmn_cost_center).

After you have configured the connector, please refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace) for more information on how to install a plugin. 

# Appendix

### **API #1: Table API**

For building this plugin, we’ll be using ServiceNow’s REST APIs, specifically the [Table API](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/xanadu-api-reference/page/integrate/inbound-rest/concept/c_TableAPI.html), which provides methods for accessing and manipulating records in database tables. 

Of the various tables that can be accessed on ServiceNow, for this use case, we are interested in the [`cmn_cost_center`](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/xanadu-source-to-pay-operations/page/product/accounts-payable-operations/reference/cost-center.html#d191812e38) table. It specifically contains information related to financial cost centers within an organization. It has filtering options as well, which we’ll be using. 

```bash
curl --request GET \
--url 'https://your-domain.service-now.com/api/now/table/cmn_cost_center'
--header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'
```
