## Introduction

The **“Lookup Direct Reports PTO on a Specific Date”** plugin enables users to check the planned PTO status of their direct reports for a specified date using SAP SuccessFactors, all through the Moveworks AI Assistant. This ensures managers have timely visibility into team availability for any given day.

This guide will walk you through installing and configuring the plugin in **Agent Studio** in just a few minutes. Let’s get started!

## **Prerequisites**

- Access to Agent Studio
- [SAP SuccessFactors Connector](https://developer.moveworks.com/creator-studio/resources/connector/?id=sap-success-factors&commit_id=21f2fb0f5f2b0852c62a72235121cd8d78d6b46b;) built in Creator Studio (follow the SAP SuccessFactors Authentication guide to create your connector).
