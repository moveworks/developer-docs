# Installation Steps

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we do recommend that you create a connector in Agent Studio before installing this plugin to streamline the process. Please follow our Zoom **Connector Guide** to do so. Once you have done this, simply follow our plugin installation documentation to get your plugin installed in minutes.

**Scopes Needed:**

- `meeting:read:list_past_participants:admin`
- `meeting:read:meeting:admin`
- `user:read:user:admin`
- For more information : [https://developers.zoom.us/docs/integrations/oauth-scopes-overview/](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/integrations/oauth-scopes-overview/)

# Appendix

## A combination of 2 APIs makes this possible:

- This API is used for retrieving the details of meeting invitees for a specific Zoom meeting. It allows you to access information about the participants invited to a meeting using the meeting's unique identifier.
    
    ```bash
    curl -X GET "https://api.zoom.us/v2/meetings/{{meeting_id}}" \
         --header "accept: application/json" \
         --header "authorization: Bearer {{personal_access_token}}" \
         --header "content-type: application/json"
    ```
    
    - Required parameters:
        - **`meeting_id`**: The unique identifier for the Zoom meeting whose invitees you are trying to retrieve. This must be replaced with the actual ID of the meeting you wish to inquire about.
- This API is used to retrieve the list of actual participants who attended a past Zoom meeting. It provides details on who participated in the meeting, including information like names, email addresses, join times, and leave times.
    
    ```bash
    curl -X GET "https://api.zoom.us/v2/past_meetings/{{meeting_Id}}/participants" \
         --header "accept: application/json" \
         --header "authorization: Bearer {{personal_access_token}}" \
         --header "content-type: application/json"
    ```
    
    - Required parameters:
        - **`meeting_Id`**: The unique identifier for a past Zoom meeting whose participant details you wish to retrieve. This ID corresponds to the specific meeting's recorded session.
