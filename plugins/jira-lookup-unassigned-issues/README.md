## Introduction

The **“Look Up Unassigned Issues”** plugin allows users to retrieve and view all currently unassigned issues from a specified Jira project directly through the Moveworks AI Assistant by either giving ‘Project name’ or ‘Project key’.  By eliminating the need to manually filter issues in Jira, this plugin provides quick visibility into unattended tasks helping teams prioritize and assign work efficiently to avoid bottlenecks or delays.

This guide will walk you through installing and configuring the plugin in **Agent Studio** in just a few minutes. Let’s get started
