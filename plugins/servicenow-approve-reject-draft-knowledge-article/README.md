## Introduction
 
The **Approve / Reject Knowledge Articles** plugin allows approvers to review and take action on knowledge articles directly through the Moveworks AI Assistant, without logging into the ServiceNow system. This streamlines the article approval workflow, speeds up decision-making, and ensures timely publishing while maintaining content quality and governance. Approvers can also preview the article’s content before making their decision.
 
This guide will walk you through installing and configuring the plugin in **Agent Studio** in just a few minutes. Let’s get started

## Installation Steps
 
We recommend setting up **ServiceNow** before installing this plugin. Please follow the [ServiceNow Connector](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=servicenow&hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) guide to configure the connection.
 
Ensure the following permissions are granted:
 
- **Table Access**:
    - `Read` access to the `kb_knowledge` and `sysapproval_approver` tables
    - `Update` access to the `kb_knowledge` table (to approve or reject articles)
- **Field Access**: Sufficient access to retrieve and update information related to knowledge article approvals
 
Once the connector is successfully configured, follow our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for detailed steps on how to install and activate the plugin in **Agent Studio**.
