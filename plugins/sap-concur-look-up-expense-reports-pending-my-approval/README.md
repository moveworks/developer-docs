# Installation Steps

We recommend creating the connector for SAP Concur first, prior to installing this plugin. Please follow the [SAP Concur Connector Guide](https://developer.moveworks.com/creator-studio/resources/connector/?id=sap-concur) to create the connector. Note that for Look Up Expense Reports Pending My Approval, you will also need to add the following permissions (the connector guide will walk you through how to add permissions):

- expense.report.read
- expense.report.readwrite
- identity.user.ids.read
- identity.user.core.read
- identity.user.coresensitive.read
- identity.user.enterprise.read
- identity.user.sap.read

Refer to [SAP Concur Scope Usage](https://developer.concur.com/api-reference/expense/expense-report/v4.reports.html#scope-usage) for full details.

After you have configured the connector, please refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace) for more information on how to install a plugin. 

# Appendix

### **API #1: Get User ID by Email**

The [Identity API](https://developer.concur.com/api-reference/profile/v4.1.identity.html#search-for-users-) in SAP Concur allows you to perform various operations on the user entity. We’ll use this API call to get the User ID of a user (through their email). This User ID will be used in the next step to get their pending expense report approvals. 

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://your-domain.com/profile/identity/v4.1/Users/.search' \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: BEARER {token}'
```

With the following JSON payload:

```json
{
  "schemas": [ "urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:concur:2.0:SearchRequest" ],
  "filter": "emails.value eq \"example@email.com\"",
  "attributes": [ "emails" ]
}
```

### **API #2: View Pending Expense Report Approvals by Approver ID**

The [Expense Reports](https://developer.concur.com/api-reference/expense/expense-report/v4.reports.html#get-reports-to-approve) API allows you to perform various actions on expense reports in SAP Concur. We’ll be using the GET call to fetch the expense reports which has the user added as an approver. 

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://your-domain.com/api/expensereports/v4/users/{userId}/context/MANAGER/reportsToApprove' \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: BEARER {token}'
```

With the following example params:

- Key: sort
Value: reportDate
- Key: order
Value: desc
- Key: includeDelegateApprovals
Value: true
