## Introduction

The **“Get Team Performance Ratings”** plugin enables managers to get a quick summary of their team’s performance ratings for calibration meetings using **Workday**, all through the Moveworks AI Assistant. This helps managers prepare efficiently without having to navigate Workday manually.

This guide will walk you through installing and configuring the plugin in **Agent Studio** in just a few minutes. Let’s get started!

## **Prerequisites**

- Access to Agent Studio

## **What are we building?**

## Installation Steps

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we recommend setting up the connector in **Agent Studio** beforehand to simplify the process. Please follow our [**Workday Connector Guide**](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=workday&hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) for detailed instructions. Once completed, proceed to install the plugin and complete the setup efficiently.

For this plugin, ensure the Workday integration system user has the following permissions:

**Required Permissions:**

- `View access` to Employee Performance data
- `View access` to Team Performance Ratings

**Tenant Configuration:**

All Workday API endpoints in this plugin use `<TENANT>` as a placeholder. After installation, replace `<TENANT>` in the action definitions with your actual Workday tenant name.

To find your tenant name:

- Log into Workday.
- Check the URL in your browser — the tenant name appears after `workday.com/`, e.g.:
    
    `https://impl.workday.com/**your_tenant**/...`
    

Make sure to update this across all actions that reference the Workday API.

After configuring the connector, refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on completing the setup.

}'
```

**Request Body Parameters:**

- `email` (string) – The primary home email address of the worker used to look up their Workday ID

### **API #2: Get Direct Reports of the Worker**

```

**Parameters:**

- **`WORKER_ID`**(string) – Filter direct reports for a specific worker ID

### **API #3: Get Performance Ratings for a Worker**

```bash
curl --location 'https://<API_SERVER_DOMAIN>/ccx/api/wql/v1/<TENANT>/data' \

--data '{
  "query": "SELECT employeeID, worker, workdayID, manager_Level01, managementChain_Level02, position, tenureCategory_Position, jobProfile, timeInJobProfile, compensationGrade, managementLevel, location, costCenter, supervisoryOrganization, cf_TalentPlacementCategory, talentMatrixPlacement, potential_CompletedRating, lastReview_OverallRating, cf_PerformanceRatingWorkRating, talentMatrixPlacementRow, talentMatrixPlacementColumn FROM workersForHCMReporting (dataSourceFilter = allActiveWorkers) WHERE workdayID = ''{{WORKER_ID}}''"
}'
```

**Query Parameters:**

- `WORKER_ID`(string) – The unique Workday ID of the worker whose performance ratings you want to retrieve
