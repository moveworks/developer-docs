## Installation Steps

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we recommend setting up the connector in **Agent Studio** beforehand to simplify the process. Please follow our [**Workday Connector Guide**](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=workday&hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) for detailed instructions. Once completed, proceed to install the plugin and complete the setup efficiently.

For this plugin, ensure the Workday integration system user has the following permissions:

**Required Permissions:**

- `View access` to Bonus Details

After configuring the connector, refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on completing the setup
