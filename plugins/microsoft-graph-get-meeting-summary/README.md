# Installation Steps

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we do recommend that you create a connector in Agent Studio before installing this plugin to streamline the process.

**Permissions Needed:**

- `OnlineMeetings.Read.All`
- `OnlineMeetings.ReadWrite.All`
- `OnlineMeetingTranscript.Read.All`
- `OnlineMeetingArtifact.Read.All`
- `OnlineMeetingRecording.Read.All`
