# Installation Steps

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we do recommend that you create a connector in Agent Studio before installing this plugin to streamline the process.

**Permissions Needed:**

- `OnlineMeetings.Read.All`
- `OnlineMeetings.ReadWrite.All`
- `OnlineMeetingTranscript.Read.All`
- `OnlineMeetingArtifact.Read.All`
- `OnlineMeetingRecording.Read.All`

# Appendix

    ```bash
    curl -X GET "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/{{user_email}}" \
         --header "accept: application/json" \
         --header "authorization: Bearer {{personal_access_token}}" \
         --header "content-type: application/json"
    ```
    
    - Required parameters:
        - **`user_email`**: User’s email.
- The second API call is designed to retrieve the online meeting object using join web url.
    
    ```bash
    curl -X GET "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/{{userid}}/onlineMeetings/?$filter=JoinWebUrl eq '{{weburl}}'" \
         --header "accept: application/json" \
         --header "authorization: Bearer {{personal_access_token}}" \
         --header "content-type: application/json"
    ```
    
    - Required parameters:
        - **`userid`**: The identifier for the user to whose meeting list the query pertains.
        - **`weburl`**: The exact web URL link for the meeting, used to filter and identify the specific meeting.
- The third API is responsible for retrieving the meeting transcripts using the meeting ID obtained from the API response.

         --header "accept: application/json" \

         --header "accept: application/json" \
         --header "authorization: Bearer {{personal_access_token}}" \
