This guide will walk you through installing and configuring the plugin in **Agent Studio** in just a few minutes. Let’s get started!

the experience we are going to build.

## **Installation Steps:-**

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we recommend setting up the connector in **Agent Studio** beforehand to streamline the process. Please follow our [**Salesforce Connector**](https://marketplace.moveworks.com/connectors/salesforce?hist=home%2Cplgn.salesforce-create-campaign-inside-account%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) Guide for detailed instructions. Once completed, proceed to install the plugin and complete the setup efficiently.

For this plugin, ensure the Salesforce integration user has the following permissions:

**Required Permissions:**

- **`Read access`** to Salesforce objects (**Account, Task, Event, Opportunity, Case, Contact, and CampaignMember**) for retrieving account details, recent activities, opportunities, cases, contacts, and campaign associations.
- **`API Enabled permission`**  – required to execute SOQL queries and composite batch requests through the Salesforce REST API.

After configuring the connector, refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on completing the setup
