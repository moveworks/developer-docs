**Object Access**:

- `Read` and `Create` access to the **Task** object
- `Read` access to the **Lead** object

After you have configured the connector, Please refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on how to install a plugin in Agent Studio.
