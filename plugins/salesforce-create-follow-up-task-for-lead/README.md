## **Installation Steps**

We recommend creating the connector for **Salesforce** first, prior to installing this plugin. Please follow the  [Salesforce Connector](https://marketplace.moveworks.com/connectors/salesforce#how-to-implement) guide to set up the connector.

**Object Access**:

- `Read` and `Create` access to the **Task** object
- `Read` access to the **Lead** object

After you have configured the connector, Please refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on how to install a plugin in Agent Studio.
