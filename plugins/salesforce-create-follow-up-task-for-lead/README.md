# Create a Follow-up Task for a Lead

## **Introduction**

The **“Create a Follow-up Task for a Lead”** plugin makes it easy to schedule follow-up tasks for your sales leads directly in the Moveworks AI Assistant.

This ensures no lead is missed, helps sales teams stay organized, and improves follow-ups without the need for manual work.

This guide will show you how to quickly set up and customize the plugin in Agent Studio. Let’s get started!
