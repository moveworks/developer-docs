## **Introduction**

The “View My Stock Grant Summary” plugin enables employees to quickly access their stock grant details directly through the Moveworks AI Assistant. By pulling data from Workday, this plugin provides a seamless way to view the number of shares granted, the current value per share, and the total stock value.

This guide will walk you through installing and configuring the plugin in **Agent Studio** in just a few minutes. Let’s get started!

## **Prerequisites**

- Access to Agent Studio

## **Installation Steps**

We recommend creating the connector for **Workday** first, prior to installing this plugin. Please follow the [Workday Connector](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=workday&hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) guide to set up the connector.

**Note**: To enable the **View My Stock Grant Summary** functionality, ensure your Workday integration system user has the necessary domain permissions.

Specifically, the following domain permissions must be granted with both **View** and **Get** access:

- **Stock Grants** – to retrieve employee stock grant records and details
- **Worker Data: Self-Service** – to ensure employees can securely retrieve their own stock-related information

**Tenant Configuration:**

All Workday API endpoints in this plugin use `<TENANT>` as a placeholder. After installation, replace `<TENANT>` in the action definitions with your actual Workday tenant name.

To find your tenant name:

- Log into Workday.
- Check the URL in your browser — the tenant name appears after `workday.com/`, e.g.: [`https://impl.workday.com/**your_tenant**/...`](https://impl.workday.com/**your_tenant**/...)

Make sure to update this across all actions that reference the Workday API.

After configuring the connector and updating your tenant, refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on completing the setup.
