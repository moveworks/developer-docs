## **Introduction**

The **“Request New Badge”** plugin allows employees to quickly request a new or replacement badge for office access directly through the Moveworks AI Assistant.

## **Installation Steps**

We recommend setting up **ServiceNow** before installing this plugin. Please follow the [ServiceNow Connector](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=servicenow&hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) guide to configure the connection.

 Note: To enable the Request New Badge functionality, ensure the ServiceNow integration user has the appropriate table-level permissions.

Specifically, confirm the following permissions are granted:

- **Table Access**: `Read` and `Create` access to the `sys_user` and `incident` tables.

Once the connector is successfully configured, follow our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for detailed steps on how to install and activate the plugin in **Agent Studio**.
