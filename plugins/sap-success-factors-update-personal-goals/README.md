## Installation Steps

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we recommend setting up the connector in **Agent Studio** beforehand to streamline the process.

Once completed, proceed to install the plugin and complete the setup efficiently.

For this plugin, ensure the SAP SuccessFactors integration user has the following permission:

**Required Scope:**

- `Add` access to the **Goal Plan** entity

After configuring the connector, refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on completing the setup.
