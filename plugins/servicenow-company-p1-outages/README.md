# **Introduction :**

The **“Find Company P1 Outages”** plugin allows employees to quickly view the active Priority 1 (P1) outages impacting the company in ServiceNow directly through the Moveworks AI Assistant. This plugin streamlines the process by retrieving outage information without manual searching in ServiceNow.

This guide will walk you through installing and configuring the plugin in Agent Studio, so your team can easily access real-time P1 outage information and respond proactively.

Let’s get started!

# **Installation Steps**

We recommend setting up **ServiceNow** before installing this plugin. Please follow the [ServiceNow Connector](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=servicenow&hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) guide to configure the connection.

For this plugin, ensure the user has the following permissions:

- **Table Access**: `Read` access to the `cmdb_ci_outage` table.

Once the connector is successfully configured, follow our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for detailed steps on how to install and activate the plugin in **Agent Studio**.
