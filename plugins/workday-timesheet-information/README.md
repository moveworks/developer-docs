# **Introduction:**

The **Look Up Timesheet Information** plugin enables real-time access to Workday timesheet data through the Moveworks AI Assistant. Managers and employees can instantly retrieve timesheet statuses, hours logged, and approval workflows—without leaving their conversation interface.

This guide details the quick setup to activate timesheet lookups in minutes.

# **Prerequisites :**

- Access to Agent Studio

# **Installation Steps**

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we recommend setting up the connector in **Agent Studio** beforehand to simplify the process. Please follow our [**Workday Connector Guide**](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=workday&hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) for detailed instructions. Once completed, proceed to install the plugin and complete the setup efficiently.

For this plugin, ensure the Workday integration system user has the following permissions:

## **Required Permissions:**

- `View and Modify access`to worker data : Time Tracking
- `Get and Put access`to worker data : Time Tracking

> Note: Ensure Workday domain security policies grant API access to these functions.
> 

**Tenant Configuration:**

All Workday API endpoints in this plugin use`<TENANT>`as a placeholder. After installation, replace`<TENANT>`in the action definitions with your actual Workday tenant name.

To find your tenant name:

- Log into Workday.
- Check the URL in your browser — the tenant name appears after`workday.com/`, e.g.:
    
    `https://impl.workday.com/**your_tenant**/...`
    

Make sure to update this across all actions that reference the Workday API.

After configuring the connector and updating your tenant, refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on completing the setup.
