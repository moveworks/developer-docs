# **Introduction:**

The **View Open Jobs** plugin provides real-time access to Workday’s active job postings through the Moveworks AI Assistant. Recruiters, hiring managers, and employees can instantly search open positions by department, location, or job family—all within chat.

This guide covers the step-by-step setup to enable job lookup functionality.

# **Installation Steps**

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we recommend setting up the connector in **Agent Studio** beforehand to simplify the process. Please follow our [**Workday Connector Guide**](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=workday&hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) for detailed instructions. Once completed, proceed to install the plugin and complete the setup efficiently.

For this plugin, ensure the Workday integration system user has the following permissions:

## **Required Permissions:**

- Get access ****to reference data: **Recruiting**
- View access to worker data: **Positions**
- View access ****to reference data: **Job Requisitions**

> Note: Requires "Staffing" domain permissions in Workday.
> 

**Tenant Configuration:**

All Workday API endpoints in this plugin use`<TENANT>`as a placeholder. After installation, replace`<TENANT>`in the action definitions with your actual Workday tenant name.

To find your tenant name:

- Log into Workday.
- Check the URL in your browser — the tenant name appears after`workday.com/`, e.g.:
    
    `https://impl.workday.com/**your_tenant**/...`
    

Make sure to update this across all actions that reference the Workday API.

After configuring the connector and updating your tenant, refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on completing the setup.

# **Appendix**

## **API #1: Fetch open jobs**

The **Get Job openings** API enables users to retrieve comprehensive details about open job postings from Workday. By leveraging Workday's reporting and APIs, this functionality ensures efficient and precise data retrieval, even in environments with a large number of job openings.

```bash
curl --request GET
--location 'https://<DOMAIN>.myworkday.com/api/recruiting/v3/<INSTANCE>/jobPostings' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```
