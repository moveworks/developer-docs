# **Installation Steps**

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we recommend creating a connector in Agent Studio beforehand to streamline the process. Please follow our [Workday Connector Guide](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=workday&hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) to do so. Once completed, follow our plugin installation documentation to install the  **Look Up Holiday Schedule** plugin in minutes.

For **Look Up Holiday Schedule**, you will also need to ensure the following permissions are in place:

**Required Scopes:**

- `User Profile Access`
- `Employee Data Access`

After configuring the connector, refer to our [**plugin installation documentation**](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation)  for more details on completing the setup.
