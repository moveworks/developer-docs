# **Installation Steps**

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we recommend setting up the connector in **Agent Studio** beforehand to simplify the process. Please follow our [**Workday Connector Guide**](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=workday&hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) for detailed instructions. Once completed, proceed to install the plugin and complete the setup efficiently.

For this plugin, ensure the Workday integration system user has the following permissions:

## **Required Permissions:**

- `View access`to worker data : Time Tracking
- `Get access`to worker data : Time Codes

> Note: Ensure Workday domain security policies grant API access to these functions.
> 

**Tenant Configuration:**

All Workday API endpoints in this plugin use`<TENANT>`as a placeholder. After installation, replace`<TENANT>`in the action definitions with your actual Workday tenant name.

To find your tenant name:

- Log into Workday.
- Check the URL in your browser — the tenant name appears after`workday.com/`, e.g.:
    
    `https://impl.workday.com/**your_tenant**/...`
    

Make sure to update this across all actions that reference the Workday API.

After configuring the connector and updating your tenant, refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on completing the setup.

# **Appendix**

## **API #1: GET Worker ID**

The Get Worker Id API uses WQL to retrieve the worker ID.

```bash
curl --request POST \
curl --location 'https://<DOMAIN>.myworkday.com/api/wql/v1/<TENANT>/data?offset=0&limit=1' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "query": "SELECT workdayID, fullName,businessTitle, email_PrimaryWorkOrPrimaryHome,employeeID FROM allWorkers WHERE email_PrimaryWorkOrPrimaryHome = '{{email_PrimaryWorkOrPrimaryHome}}'"
}
'

```

**Request Body Fields :**

- email(string) – The email address of the user whose worker id and timezone want to retrieve.

## **API #2: Get TimeEntryCode**

The **Get TimeEntryCode** API retrieves a worker's TimeEntryCode based on their Worker ID from Workday. This API is essential for fetching the worker's time entry codes for a specified date and in/out code.

```bash
curl --location 'https://<YOUR_DOMAIN>/api/timeTracking/v3/<INSTANCE_ID>/values/timeTypes/timeEntryCodes?date=<DATE>&inOutCodeOnly=true&worker=<WORKER_ID>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>'
```

**Query Parameters :**

- WORKER_ID(string) – The worker id of the user whose even type id want to view.
- DATE(string) – The random date.
