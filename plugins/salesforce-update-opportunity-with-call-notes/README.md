## **Installation Steps**

We recommend setting up **Salesforce** before installing this plugin. Please follow the [Salesforce Connector](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=salesforce&hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) guide to configure the connection.

Note: To enable the Update an Opportunity with Call Notes functionality, ensure the Salesforce integration user has appropriate object and field-level permissions.

Specifically, confirm the following permissions are granted:

- **Object Access**: `Read` and `Edit` access to the **Opportunity** object
- **Field Access**: `Read` and `Edit` access to fields used for call notes (e.g., **Description**, **Next Steps**, **Call Notes**, or any custom fields used in your org)

Once the connector is successfully configured, follow our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for detailed steps on how to install and activate the plugin in **Agent Studio**.
