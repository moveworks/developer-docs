# **Introduction :**

The **“Set Goals For Direct Reports”** plugin allows managers to seamlessly set performance goals for their direct reports in Workday - all through the Moveworks AI Assistant. This eliminates the need for manual navigation to Workday and streamlines the goal-setting process.

This guide will walk you through installing and configuring the plugin in **Agent Studio** in just a few minutes.

Let’s get started!

# **Installation Steps**

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we recommend setting up the connector in **Agent Studio** beforehand to simplify the process. Please follow our [**Workday Connector Guide**](https://marketplace.moveworks.com/connectors/workday?hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) for detailed instructions. Once completed, proceed to install the plugin and complete the setup efficiently.

For this plugin, ensure the Workday integration system user has the following permissions:

**Required Permissions:**

- **`View access`** to Worker Profile
- **`View and modify access`** to Performance Goals / Goal Details

**Tenant Configuration:**

All Workday API endpoints in this plugin use **`{{TENANT}}`** as a placeholder. After installation, replace **`{{TENANT}}`** in the action definitions with your actual Workday tenant name.

To find your tenant name:

- Log into Workday.
- Check the URL in your browser — the tenant name appears after `workday.com/`, e.g.:
    
    `https://impl.workday.com/**your_tenant**/...`
    

Make sure to update this across all actions that reference the Workday API.

After configuring the connector and updating your tenant, refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on completing the setup.
