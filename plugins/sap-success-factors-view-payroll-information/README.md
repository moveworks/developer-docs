# **Installation Steps**

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we recommend setting up the connector in **Agent Studio** beforehand to streamline the process. Please follow our [**SAP SuccessFactors Connector Guide**](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=sap-success-factors&hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) for detailed instructions. Once completed, proceed to install the plugin and complete the setup efficiently.

For this plugin, ensure the SAP SuccessFactors integration user has the following permissions:

**Required Scopes:**

- `View` access to the **User** entity

After configuring the connector, refer to our [**plugin installation documentation**](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on completing the setup.
