## **Installation Steps:-**

We recommend creating the connector for Servicenow first, prior to installing this plugin. Please follow the  [Servicenow Connector](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=servicenow&hist=home) guide to set up the connector.

After you have configured the connector, Please refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on how to install a plugin in Agent Studio.

## **Customization Process**

We use a **custom field** for capturing **Business Justification**. If your instance already has a similar field, you can modify the plugin action to reference your existing field. If not, follow the steps below to create one:

### Steps to Add a Custom Field in *Requested Item*:

1. Navigate to **All → Requested Item** and open any record.
2. Click the **three horizontal bars** (also known as the "hamburger menu") next to the *Requested Item* header.
3. Go to **Configure → Form Layout**.
4. In the layout screen, you'll see two columns:
    - **Available** (fields not currently on the form)
    - **Selected** (fields currently on the form)
5. Look for any existing field like `Business Justification` or similar in the **Available** box:
    - If found, move it to the **Selected** box and click **Save**.
    - If not found, scroll down to the **Create New Field** section.
6. Provide the field details:
    - **Name**: e.g., `u_business_justification`
    - **Type**: String (or your preferred type)
    - **Field Length**: e.g.,`Large (1000)`
7. Click **Add**, then **Save** to apply the changes.

## **Appendix:-**

  "u_business_justification": "<your-business-justification>",
  "requested_for": "<user-email>",
  "cat_item": "<software-name>",
  "approval": "requested"
}'
```
