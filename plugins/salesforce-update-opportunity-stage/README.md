# **Introduction :**

The **“Update Opportunity Stage”** plugin enables users to quickly update the stage of an existing opportunity in **Salesforce**, all through the Moveworks AI Assistant. This streamlines the process for sales and support teams by eliminating the need to manually navigate Salesforce to locate and modify opportunity records.

This guide will walk you through installing and configuring the plugin in **Agent Studio** in just a few minutes.

Let’s get started!

# Prerequisites :

- Access to Agent Studio
- The  **Salesforce Lookup Opportunity** is a plugin built in **Agent Studio** that allows users to retrieve opportunity details for a specific account name and check their stages based on a query. For setup instructions, refer to the [**Salesforce Lookup Opportunity](https://developer.moveworks.com/creator-studio/resources/plugin?id=salesforce-opportunity-information)** guide.

# **Installation Steps**

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we recommend setting up the connector in **Agent Studio** beforehand to streamline the process. Please follow our [**Salesforce Connector Guide**](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=salesforce&hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) for detailed instructions. Once completed, proceed to install the plugin and complete the setup efficiently.

For this plugin, ensure the Salesforce integration user has the following permissions:

- `Read` access to the **Account** object
- `Read` and `Update` access to the **Opportunity** object

After configuring the connector, refer to our **[plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation)** for more details on completing the setup!
