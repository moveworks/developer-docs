# Research
We know that you can use the Concur [Expense Reports v4](https://developer.concur.com/api-reference/expense/expense-report/v4.reports.html) and [Workflows v4 API](https://developer.concur.com/api-reference/expense/expense-report/v4.workflows.html) to create expense entries for a user. You can learn more about the API [here](https://developer.concur.com/api-reference/expense/expense-report/v4.reports.html).
