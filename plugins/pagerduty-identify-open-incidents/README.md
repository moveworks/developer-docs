# Identify Open Incidents

## **Introduction:-**

The **“Identify Open Incidents”** Plugin equips support and incident response teams with instant visibility into unresolved incidents in PagerDuty. By surfacing active (non-resolved) incidents directly in Moveworks conversations, this plugin streamlines triage, reduces time spent checking external dashboards, and accelerates issue resolution.

This guide will walk you through installing and configuring the plugin in Agent Studio in just a few minutes. Let’s get started!

## **Prerequisites:-**

• Access to **Agent Studio**

## **What are we building?**

**Agent Design:-**
