# **Introduction**

The **Search a Question on StackOverflow for Teams** plugin enhances the Moveworks AI Assistant by allowing users to search through their organization’s private Stack Overflow for Teams knowledge base directly from their chat interface. This integration empowers team members to quickly access proprietary programming solutions, best practices, and expert advice tailored specifically to their organization, all without leaving the Moveworks environment.

# Prerequisites

- Access to Agent Studio
- [Stackoverflow Connector](https://developer.moveworks.com/creator-studio/resources/connector/?id=stackoverflow) set up in Creator Studio.
