## **Installation Steps**

We recommend creating the connector for **Workday** first, prior to installing this plugin. Please follow the [Workday Connector](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=workday&hist=home%2Cbrws#step-4-add-domain-security-policies-to-the-integration-systems-security-group) guide to set up the connector.

Note: For the View Total Compensation functionality to work correctly, ensure your Workday integration system user has the necessary domain permissions.

Specifically, ensure the following domain permissions are assigned with both **View** and **Get** access:

- Compensation
- Bonus
- Benefits

Once the connector is configured, refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on how to install a plugin in Agent Studio.
