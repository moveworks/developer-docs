## Introduction

The **“Summarize Interview Feedback”** plugin enables hiring managers to instantly consolidate and review candidate interview evaluations within SAP SuccessFactors using the Moveworks AI Assistant. It provides feedback on key aspects such as candidate strengths, areas for improvement, and overall evaluator sentiment. This empowers managers to make faster, data-driven hiring decisions, streamline the recruitment process, and reduce delays—without navigating lengthy feedback forms.

This guide will walk you through installing and configuring the plugin in **Agent Studio** in just a few minutes. Let’s get started!

## Installation Steps

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we recommend setting up the connector in **Agent Studio** beforehand to streamline the process. Please follow our [SAP SuccessFactors](https://marketplace.moveworks.com/connectors/sap-success-factors#how-to-implement) for detailed instructions. Once completed, proceed to install the plugin and complete the setup efficiently.

For this plugin, ensure the SAP SuccessFactors integration user has the following permissions:

**Required Scopes:**

- `Read` access to **JobRequisition, JobReqLocale, JobApplication, JobApplicationComments, ManagerRating, Candidate**

After configuring the connector, refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on completing the setup
