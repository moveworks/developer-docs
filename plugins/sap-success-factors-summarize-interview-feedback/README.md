## Introduction

The **“Summarize Interview Feedback”** plugin enables hiring managers to instantly consolidate and review candidate interview evaluations within SAP SuccessFactors using the Moveworks AI Assistant. It provides feedback on key aspects such as candidate strengths, areas for improvement, and overall evaluator sentiment. This empowers managers to make faster, data-driven hiring decisions, streamline the recruitment process, and reduce delays—without navigating lengthy feedback forms.

This guide will walk you through installing and configuring the plugin in **Agent Studio** in just a few minutes. Let’s get started!

## **Installation Steps**

We recommend setting up **SAP SuccessFactors** before installing this plugin. Please follow the  [SAP SuccessFactors Connector](https://marketplace.moveworks.com/connectors/sap-success-factors#how-to-implement) guide to configure the connection.

### **Required Permissions:**

Your integration user must have **Read access** to the following entities in **SAP SuccessFactors**:

- **JobRequisition** – Contains details of open job requisitions, including the hiring manager and job title.
- **JobReqLocale** – Stores localized information for job requisitions, such as job title and description.
- **JobApplication** – Represents a candidate’s application for a specific job requisition.
- **JobApplicationComments** – Includes interview feedback and evaluator comments associated with a job application.
- **ManagerRating** – Stores manager ratings or evaluations linked to a job application.
- **Candidate** – Contains basic candidate profile data such as candidate ID, name, and contact details.

**Your Instance Configuration**

All SAP SuccessFactors API endpoints in this plugin use **`'YOUR_INSTANCE'`** as a placeholder. After installation, replace **`'YOUR_INSTANCE'`** in the action definitions with your actual SuccessFactors instance name.

To find your instance name:

1. Log in to your SAP SuccessFactors account.
2. Check the URL in your browser — the instance name appears before `.successfactors.com`
    - e.g., [https://corp123.successfactors.com](https://corp123.successfactors.com/) → instance name = **`corp123`**

**API Domain Configuration**

SAP SuccessFactors uses **region-specific API domains**. To ensure your API calls connect to the correct tenant:

1. Identify your instance name (as shown above)
2. Refer to SAP’s official API server list to select the correct regional domain: [**List of SAP SuccessFactors API Servers — OData v2**](https://help.sap.com/docs/successfactors-platform/sap-successfactors-api-reference-guide-odata-v2/list-of-sap-successfactors-api-servers?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
3. Replace **`'YOUR_INSTANCE'`** and use the appropriate API domain based on your region
    - e.g., [https://apicorp123.successfactors.com](https://apicorp123.successfactors.com/)

Note: SAP does not support IP-based endpoints — always use official SAP domain URLs.

Make sure to update this across all actions that reference the SAP SuccessFactors API.

Once the connector is successfully configured, follow our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for detailed steps on how to install and activate the plugin in **Agent Studio**.

### API 2: Get Candidates by Job Requisition ID

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url "https://<YOUR_INSTANCE>/odata/v2/JobApplication?\$filter=jobReqId eq {{JOB_REQ_ID}} and substringof('Interview', jobAppStatus/appStatusName)&\$select=candidateId,firstName,lastName,applicationId,currentTitle&\$top=200&\$orderby=lastModifiedDateTime desc&\$format=json" \
