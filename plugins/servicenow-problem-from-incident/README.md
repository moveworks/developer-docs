## **Introduction**

The **“Create a Problem from an Incident”** plugin makes it easy to turn an existing incident into a problem using the Moveworks AI Assistant. This helps IT teams effectively track and resolve recurring or complex issues. It also improves visibility and follow-up by organizing such incidents into dedicated problem records.

This guide will walk you through installing and configuring the plugin in **Agent Studio**, so your team can quickly convert incidents into problems and streamline issue management. Let’s get started!

## **Prerequisites**

- Access to Agent Studio

## **Installation Steps**

We recommend setting up **ServiceNow** before installing this plugin. Please follow the [ServiceNow Connector](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=servicenow&hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) guide to configure the connection.

Note: To enable the Create a Problem from an Incident functionality, ensure the ServiceNow integration user has the appropriate table-level permissions.

Specifically, confirm the following permissions are granted:

- **Table Access**: `Read` and `Create` access to the `problem` table
- **Field Access**: `Read` access to the `incident` table and `Write` access to the `problem_id` field (on the incident record)

Once the connector is successfully configured, follow our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for detailed steps on how to install and activate the plugin in **Agent Studio**.
