## Introduction

The **“Create a Contact Inside an Account”** plugin allows users to quickly create a new contact under an existing account in **Salesforce**, all through the Moveworks AI Assistant.

This guide will walk you through installing and configuring the plugin in **Agent Studio** in just a few minutes. Let’s get started!

## **Prerequisites**

- Access to Agent Studio

## Installation Steps

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we recommend setting up the connector in **Agent Studio** beforehand to streamline the process. Please follow our [**Salesforce Connector Guide**](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=salesforce&hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) for detailed instructions. Once completed, proceed to install the plugin and complete the setup efficiently.

For this plugin, ensure the Salesforce integration user has the following permissions:

**Required Permissions:**

- `Read` access to the **Account** object
- `Create` and `Read` access to the **Contact** object

After configuring the connector, refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on completing the setup
