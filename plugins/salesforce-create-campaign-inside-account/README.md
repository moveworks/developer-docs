# **Installation Steps**

We recommend creating the connector for Salesforce first, prior to installing this plugin. Please follow the [Salesforce Connector](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package?id=salesforce&hist=home%2Cplgn.salesforce-create-campaign-inside-account%2Cbrws) guide to set up the connector.

Once the connector is configured, refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on how to install a plugin in Agent Studio.

After configuring the connector, refer to our installation documentation for more details on completing the setup.

## **Customization Process**
 
To associate a Campaign with an Account, we use a custom lookup field named `Account__c` on the Campaign object. If you already have a similar custom field, you can update the plugin’s action to reference your existing field.
 
If not, follow the steps below to create this custom field:
 
## **Steps to Create ‘Account’ Custom Field on Accounts Module**
 
1. **Go to Setup**
    - Click the gear icon and select **Setup**
2. **Open Object Manager**
    - In Setup, select **Object Manager**.
    - Search for and select **Campaign**.
3. **Create Custom Fields**
    - Click **Fields & Relationships** in the left menu.
    - Click **Next**
    - Click **New** to create a new field.
    - Select **Lookup Relationship** as the field type, then click **Next**.
    - In the “Related To” dropdown, select **Account**, then click **Next**.
4. **Configure Field Details**
    - **Field Label**: `Account`
    - **Field Name**: `Account`
    - When you reach the **Field-Level Security** step during the custom field creation, **do not make any changes** to the default selections
    - Then, click the **Next** button to continue.
    - When you reach the **Add custom related lists** step during the custom field creation, do not make any changes to the default selections
    - Click the **Save & New** button
 
Once done, your `Account__c` field is ready to be used in the API to associate campaigns with accounts.
