# Introduction

The **Create Ticket Subtasks** plugin allows users to add subtasks to existing ServiceNow tickets directly through the Moveworks AI Assistant. This enables users to break down larger incidents into manageable components while maintaining proper tracking and accountability.

This guide will help you install this plugin within minutes in Agent Studio. Let’s get started!

# Prerequisites

- Access to Agent Studio
- **ServiceNow Connector** built in Creator Studio (follow the [ServiceNow Connector Guide](https://developer.moveworks.com/creator-studio/resources/connector?id=servicenow) to create your connector)

# Installation Steps

We recommend creating the connector for **ServiceNow** first, prior to installing this plugin. Please follow the [ServiceNow Connector Guide](https://developer.moveworks.com/creator-studio/resources/connector?id=servicenow) to create the connector. Note that for **Create Ticket Subtasks**, you will need to also add the following permissions (the connector guide will walk you through how to add permissions):

- Write access to `incidents` table

After you have configured the connector, please refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace) for more information on how to install a plugin.
