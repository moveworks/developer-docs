# Installation Steps

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we do recommend that you create a connector in Agent Studio before installing this plugin to streamline the process. Please follow our Gong **Connector Guide** to do so. Once you have done this, simply follow our plugin installation documentation to get your plugin installed in minutes.

# Appendix

This API allows you to fetch the transcript of a gong call. Then the llm will convert this transcript into useful action items and next steps in a concise manner.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://us-35031.api.gong.io/v2/calls/transcript" \
     --header "accept: application/json" \
     --header "authorization: Bearer {{personal_access_token}}" \
     --header "content-type: application/json" \
     --data '{
       "filter": {
         "callIds": ["{{callid}}"]
       }
     }'
```

**Required Body Parameters:**

- `callid` (string) - Gong Id of the call for which the transcript is needed.
