# **Introduction**

The **Identify Vendor Onboarding Status** plugin empowers users to instantly check the approval and activation status of vendors in Coupa directly through the Moveworks AI Assistant. Users can quickly verify if vendors are ready for business, track onboarding progress, and access critical details such as supplier ID, approval status, active/inactive state, and supplier number. This ensures procurement teams can make informed decisions and avoid delays while maintaining compliance with your company's vendor management policies.

This guide will help you install this plugin within minutes in Agent Studio. Let’s get started!

# **Installation Steps**

We recommend creating the connector for Coupa first, prior to installing this plugin. Please follow the [**Coupa Connector Guide**](https://marketplace.moveworks.com/creator-studio/resources/connector?id=coupa) to create the connector. Note that for Identify Vendor Onboarding Status, you will also need to add the following permissions (the connector guide will walk you through how to add permissions):

- Coupa User login → Setting → All Setup items → OAuth2/OpenID Connect Clients → add **`core.suppliers.read`** to integration
- Update the same scope in the MW HTTP connector as well

After you have configured the connector, please refer to our [**plugin installation documentation**](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more information on how to install a plugin.

# **Appendix**

### **API #1: View Supplier Information**

The [Suppliers](https://compass.coupa.com/en-us/products/product-documentation/integration-technical-documentation/the-coupa-core-api/resources/reference-data-resources/suppliers-api-(suppliers)) API in Coupa allows you to perform various actions on Supplier information. We’ll be using the GET call to get supplier details. To filter by name, we will use the `name[contains]` parameter for a partial match (e.g., `name[contains]=Dell`) and use the ‘fields’ parameter to limit the API response to relevant details.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://your-domain.com/api/suppliers' \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN'
```

With the following example params:

- Key: name[contains]
    - Value: {{supplier_name}}
        - Example: Dell (will return all suppliers containing this keyword in the name)
- Key: fields
    - Value: ["id","name","status","number","active","display_name","created_at","enterprise","po-email","type",{"primary_contact":["email"]},{"enterprise":["name"]},{"commodity":["name"]}]
