## **Introduction**

The **"Analyze Knowledge Article Quality"** plugin evaluates the overall quality and effectiveness of knowledge articles. When a user selects an article, the plugin retrieves its details and performs an **AI-based content analysis**, providing an **overall quality score** along with identified **gaps** and **recommendations for improvement**. The analysis covers areas such as **formatting, clarity and accessibility**, helping ensure that each article meets quality standards and enhances the user experience.

This guide will walk you through installing and configuring the plugin in **Agent Studio** in just a few minutes. Let’s get started!

## **Prerequisites**

## **Installation Steps**

We recommend setting up **ServiceNow** before installing this plugin. Please follow the [ServiceNow Connector](https://marketplace.moveworks.com/connectors/servicenow#how-to-implement) guide to configure the connection.

**Specifically, confirm the following permissions are granted:**

**Table Access:**

- `Read` access to the **kb_knowledge** table.

**Field Access:**

- `Read` access to the following fields in the **kb_knowledge** table:  **number, short_description, text, display_number, author.email**

**Your Instance Configuration:**

All ServiceNow API endpoints in this plugin use `YOUR_INSTANCE` as a placeholder. After installation, replace `YOUR_INSTANCE` in the API calls with your actual ServiceNow instance name.

To find your instance name:

- Log in to your ServiceNow account.
- Check the URL in your browser — the instance name appears before `.service-now.com`, e.g.:
    
    `https://**your_instance**.service-now.com/...`
    

Make sure to update this across all actions that reference the ServiceNow API.

Once the connector is successfully configured, follow our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for detailed steps on how to install and activate the plugin in **Agent Studio**.

## **Appendix**

### **API #1: Get Article By Number or Short Description or Author’s Email:**

```bash
curl --location 'https://<YOUR_INSTANCE>/api/now/table/kb_knowledge?sysparm_query={{filter_query}}&sysparm_fields=number,short_description,text,display_number,author.email' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
```

**Query Parameter:**

- **`$filter_query` : (string)** – Filter knowledge articles by specific property values.
    - You can filter by **article number**, **short description**, or **author email**.
        - Example filters:
            - `number=KB0012345` → Returns the article with that specific article number.
            - `short_descriptionLIKEnew` → Returns articles containing “new” in the short description.
            - `author.email=john.doe@example.com` → Returns articles created by the specific author.
- **`$sysparm` : (string)** – Selected fields to be returned.
    - Example:
        - `['number', 'short_description', 'author's email', 'text']`
- **Important Note:**
    - The **`$sysparm`** parameter lets you choose specific fields from the main entity or expanded entities.
        - Format for expanded fields: `author.email`.
