# **Installation Steps**

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we recommend creating a connector in **Agent Studio** beforehand to streamline the process. Please follow our [Salesforce Connector](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=salesforce&hist=home) Guide to do so. Once completed, follow our plugin installation documentation to install the **Lookup Opportunity Information** plugin in minutes.

## **Required Permissions:**

- **Read**
    - Access to the **Task** and **Event** objects
    - Access to related **Opportunity** and **Contact** records
    - Visibility to custom note fields (if used)

After configuring the connector, refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on completing the setup

# **Appendix**

## API #1: Query Opportunity ID using Account Name

The **Retrieve Opportunity ID by Account Name** API fetches the **Opportunity ID** for a given **Account Name**. This allows us to look up opportunities associated with a specific Salesforce account.

```bash
curl --request GET
--location 'https://<YOUR_DOMAIN>/services/data/v62.0/query?q=SELECT%20Id%20FROM%20Opportunity%20WHERE%[20Account.Name](http://20account.name/)%20like%20%3C<ACCOUNT_NAME>%3E%20ORDER%20BY%20CloseDate%20DESC%20LIMIT%201' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

**Query Parameters:**

- Account_Name(string) – The name of the Account to search for related contracts in Salesforce.

## API #2: Query Call Notes using Opportunity ID

The **Retrieve Call Notes by Opportunity ID** API fetches **Call Notes** (stored as **Tasks**) associated with a given **Opportunity** in Salesforce. This API helps retrieve call summaries linked to specific opportunities.

```bash
curl --request GET
--location 'https://<YOUR_DOMAIN>./services/data/v62.0/query?q=SELECT%20Id%2C%20Subject%2C%20Description%2C%20ActivityDate%20FROM%20Task%20WHERE%20WhatId%20%3D%20%<OPPORTUNITY_ID>%27%20' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```
