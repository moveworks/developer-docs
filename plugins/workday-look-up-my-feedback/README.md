This guide will walk you through installing and configuring the plugin in **Agent Studio** in just a few minutes. Let’s get started!

## **Prerequisites**

- Access to Agent Studio

## Installation Steps

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we recommend setting up the connector in **Agent Studio** beforehand to simplify the process. Please follow our [**Workday Connector Guide**](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=workday&hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) for detailed instructions. Once completed, proceed to install the plugin and complete the setup efficiently.

For this plugin, ensure the Workday integration system user has the following permissions:

**Required Permissions:**

- `Self-Service: Anytime Feedback` – View Own / View All
- `Worker Data: Anytime Feedback` – View Own / View All

**Required Scopes:**

- `Performance Enablement`
- `Worker Profile and Skills`

**Tenant Configuration:**

All Workday API endpoints in this plugin use `TENANT` and `API_SERVER_DOMAIN` as a placeholder. After installation, replace `TENANT` and `API_SERVER_DOMAIN` in the action definitions with your actual Workday domain and tenant name.

To find your **API server domain**:

- Log into Workday.
- Check the URL in your browser — The **API server domain** appears after `https://`, e.g.:
    
    In this case, `impl.workday.com` is your `API_SERVER_DOMAIN`.
    

To find your **tenant name**:

- Check the URL in your browser — the tenant name appears after `workday.com/`, e.g.:
    
    `https://impl.workday.com/your_tenant/...`
    

Make sure to update this across all actions that reference the Workday API.

After configuring the connector and updating your tenant, refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on completing the setup.

## **Appendix**

### API#1: Get Workday ID By Email

```bash
curl --location 'https://<API_SERVER_DOMAIN>/ccx/api/wql/v1/<TENANT>/data' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
--data-raw '{
    "query": "SELECT workdayID, company,fullName,businessTitle, email_PrimaryWorkOrPrimaryHome as email ,employeeID FROM allWorkers WHERE email_PrimaryWorkOrPrimaryHome = '\''{{EMAIL}}'\''"
}'
```

**Body Parameters:**

- `EMAIL` (string) – The primary home email address of the user to look up their Workday ID

**Note:**  The **`wql` endpoint** is not available in all tenants — it must be **enabled** in Workday **Public Web Services (PWS)**

### API#2: Get Feedback By Workday ID

```bash
curl --location 'https://<API_SERVER_DOMAIN>/ccx/api/performanceEnablement/v5/<TENANT>/workers/{{WORKER_ID}}/anytimeFeedbackEvents' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>'
```

**Query Parameters:**

- `WORKER_ID` (string) – The unique Workday ID of the user to retrieve their feedback received.

**Note:** Some tenants expose it under v4 instead of v5. If you receive a `404` error, try version `v4` instead of `v5` .
