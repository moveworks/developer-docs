# **Description**

The “**Submit PTO Request**” plugin lets employees including managers with "on-behalf-of" submission permissions easily request, validate, and track Paid Time Off (PTO) directly in Workday using the Moveworks AI Assistant, eliminating HR portal hopping and making time‑off management fast and effortless.

# **Pre-requisites**

Before installing and using the **Submit PTO Request** plugin, please ensure the following requirements are met:

## **1. Workday Connector**

This plugin requires an active Workday connector to communicate with your Workday instance.

- If you have not already configured the connector, please follow the [Workday Connector Guide](https://marketplace.moveworks.com/connectors/workday#how-to-implement) available in the Moveworks Marketplace.
- The connector must be fully set up and before installing this plugin.
- Once the connector is successfully configured, follow our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for detailed steps on how to install and activate the plugin in Agent Studio.

## **2. Workday System Requirements**

### **a. End User Permissions (Employee Persona)**

To submit a PTO request through this plugin, employees must already have permission to submit time off in Workday — the same permissions required to submit through the Workday UI.

At a minimum, employees and managers must have:

- **Time Off permissions** that allow:
    - Viewing available Time Off Types
    - Creating Time Off / PTO requests
- Access to their own **employee profiles and time account balances**
- Eligibility to submit PTO requests based on company time-off policies

> Note: The plugin does not grant new permissions. It respects existing role-based permissions and policies granted to the user in Workday.
> 

### **b. End User Permissions (Manager Persona)**

To submit PTO request for direct reports through this plugin, managers must already have permission to submit time off in Workday — the same permissions required to submit through the Workday UI.

At a minimum, managers must have:

- Time Off permissions that allow:
    - Viewing available Time Off Types of their direct reports
    - Creating Time Off / PTO requests of their direct reports
- Access to their team member profiles and time account balances
- Eligibility to submit requests for their direct reports based on company time-off policies

> Note: The plugin does not grant new permissions. It respects existing role-based permissions and policies granted to the user in Workday.
> 

### **c. API Permissions (via Integration User)**

The Workday connector uses an Integration Systems User (ISU) to process PTO requests through Workday APIs.

That admin/integration user must have permissions to:

- View Time Off requests on behalf of employees
- Read Time Off Types and Time Account information
- Validate employee eligibility and balances (as required by your configuration)
- Create Time Off requests on behalf of employees or their direct managers

These permissions are typically configured through Create Integration System User (ISU) Workday Task.

## **API Details**

<aside>

To use the curl examples below be sure to update details for <tenantUrl> and <tenantName>.

As a Workday administrator, obtain these details as follows:

1. Log in to Workday
2. In the search bar, search for **Public Web Services**
3. Open it
4. Select **Actions → Web Services → View WSDL**
5. In the WSDL file, locate:
    
    ```
    soap:address location="https://<hostname>/ccx/service/<tenant>/..."
    ```
    

The <hostname> (tenantUrl) and <tenant> (tenantName) in this URL are your **true tenant URL components**.

</aside>

### **API #1 : Fetch List of Direct Reports**

This REST API retrieves the list of a worker’s direct reports using the Workday Worker ID. This API is invoked only when the user is attempting to create a PTO request on behalf of another employee. The selected direct report’s Workday ID is then used to fetch the eligible PTO options.

```bash
curl -X GET"https://<tenantUrl>/api/v1/{tenantName}/workers/{worker_id}/directReports"\  -H"Content-Type: application/json"\
```

**Query Parameters**

- `WORKER_ID` *(string):* Workday Worker Id of either the logged-in user (Manager)

### **API #2: Lookup Workday ID by Email**

Retrieves the Workday details for a worker using an email address. This REST API is used when the user is submitting a PTO request for self, as the user’s Workday ID is required to fetch and present the eligible PTOs available for selection.

```bash
curl -X GET "https://<tenantUrl>/ccx/api/wql/v1/{tenantName}/data"\  -H"Content-Type: application/json"\  -d'{  "query": "SELECT workdayID, fullName, businessTitle, email_PrimaryWork as email, employeeID, supervisoryOrganization FROM allWorkers WHERE email_PrimaryWork = '{{email}}'"}'
```

---

**Query Parameters:**

- `email` *(string):* email address of the logged in user.

### **API #3: Fetch Eligible PTO Types**

This REST API retrieves the list of eligible PTO types for a worker using the worker’s Workday Worker ID. Since PTO eligibility varies by worker, this API is used to return the eligible PTO types for either the logged-in user (self request) or a selected direct report (on‑behalf‑of request). The PTO type selected from the returned list is then used in the final PTO submission.

```bash
curl -X GET"https://<tenantURL>/api/absenceManagement/v3/<tenantName>/workers/{{worker_id}}/eligibleAbsenceTypes?category=17bd6531c90c100016d4b06f2b8a07ce"\  -H"Content-Type: application/json"
```

---

**Query Parameters:**

- `WORKER_ID` *(string):* Workday Id of either the logged-in user (self request) or a selected direct report (on‑behalf‑of request)
- `category` *(string):* Workday GUID for Time Off event category which is static as per Workday documentation this case is : 17bd6531c90c100016d4b06f2b8a07ce.

### **API #4: Submit PTO**

Executes the final submission of a PTO request through a Workday SOAP API. It is called once the user or direct report is selected, PTO dates and per‑day quantities are confirmed, and any additional comments are provided by the user.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://<tenantUrl>/ccx/service/<tenantName>/Absence_Management/v45.1" \
  -H "Content-Type: text/xml" \
  -d "<soapenv:Envelope

### **API References**

This plugin uses a combination of **Workday APIs** and **Time Management REST APIs** to retrieve employee information, determine eligible PTO time types, and submit PTO requests.

For detailed information on request parameters, response formats, error handling, and versioning, please refer to the **official Workday API documentation** provided by Workday:

# **What Is In Scope for This Plugin?**

This plugin supports the following capabilities:

- Submit PTO requests for **limited leave types** (e.g., Vacation, Sick Leave, Casual Leave, Earned Leave, Comp Time).
- Request PTO for **past, current, or future dates**, including unplanned absences.
- Specify PTO using **natural language date expressions**, such as:
    - A specific date or date range
    - Days of the week or weeks within a month
    - Number of days within a given period
- Submit **multiple PTO requests** in a single interaction, as long as all requests are for limited leave types.
- Adding **comments or notes** to a PTO request.

- Submitting PTO requests **on behalf of another employee**, who directly report to the user.

This plugin does **not** support the following:

- Requesting **non-limited or leave-of-absence types**, such as parental leave, FMLA, or long-term disability.
- **Warning when the requested PTO exceeds the available or projected balance** for the selected dates, so employees can avoid unintentionally requesting unpaid leave.

- Uploading or linking **supporting documentation** (e.g., for Jury Duty).
- Viewing **complete PTO balances**, accrual schedules, or a full breakdown of all available leave types.
- Proactively surfacing **public holidays, weekends, or scheduled time-off conflicts** before submission.
- Displaying detailed **approval chain** information.
