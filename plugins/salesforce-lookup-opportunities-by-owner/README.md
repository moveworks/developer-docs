# **Installation Steps**

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we recommend setting up the connector in **Agent Studio** beforehand to streamline the process. Please follow our [**Salesforce Connector Guide**](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=salesforce&hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) for detailed instructions. Once completed, proceed to install the plugin and complete the setup efficiently.

For this plugin, ensure the Salesforce integration user has the following permissions:

- `Read` access to the **Account** object
- `Read` access to the **Opportunity** object

After configuring the connector, refer to our **[plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation)** for more details on completing the setup!

# **Appendix**

## API #1: **Retrieve** Account and opportunity by Owner Name

The [**Retrieve Account and opportunity by Owner Name**](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.object_reference.meta/object_reference/sforce_api_objects_opportunity.htm) API retrieves a list of account and opportunity details associated with Owner.

--header 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
--header 'Accept: application/json' \

```

**Query Parameters :**

- `Owner_Name`(string) – The name of the owner whose Account and Opportunity details are to be retrieved.
