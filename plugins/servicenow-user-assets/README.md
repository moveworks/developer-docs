# Installation Steps

We recommend creating the connector for ServiceNow first, prior to installing this plugin. Please follow the [ServiceNow Connector Guide](https://developer.moveworks.com/creator-studio/resources/connector/?id=servicenow) to create the connector. Note that for Look Up My Assets, you will need to also add the following permissions:

- **asset (Asset Manager)** role. More details [here](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/xanadu-it-service-management/page/product/asset-management/reference/r_InstalledWithAssetManagement.html).

After you have configured the connector, please refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more information on how to install a plugin. 

# Appendix

### **API #1: Table API**

For building this plugin, we’ll be using ServiceNow’s REST APIs, specifically the [Table API](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/xanadu-api-reference/page/integrate/inbound-rest/concept/c_TableAPI.html), which provides methods for accessing and manipulating records in database tables. 

Of the various tables that can be accessed on ServiceNow, for this use case, we are interested in the [**`alm_asset`**](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/xanadu-it-service-management/page/product/asset-management/reference/r_InstalledWithAssetManagement.html) table. It specifically contains information about the assets—both IT and non-IT—that are managed within ServiceNow. The API provides filtering options as well, which we will be using to extract meaningful data. 

```bash
curl --request GET \
--url '[https://your-domain.service-now.com/api/now/table/alm_asset?](https://api/now/table/alm_asset?sysparm_query=assigned_to.email%3Dexample%40email.com&sysparm_fields=model_category.name,display_name,asset_tag)sysparm_query=assigned_to.email%3Dexample%[40email.com](http://40email.com/)&sysparm_fields=model_category.name%2C%20display_name%2C%20asset_tag\'
