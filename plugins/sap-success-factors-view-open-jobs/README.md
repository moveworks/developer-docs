# **Installation Steps**

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we recommend creating a connector in Agent Studio beforehand to streamline the process. Please follow our  [SAP Successfactors Connector Guide](https://developer.moveworks.com/creator-studio/resources/connector/?id=sap-success-factors&commit_id=21f2fb0f5f2b0852c62a72235121cd8d78d6b46b;) to do so. Once completed, follow our plugin installation documentation to install the  **View Open Jobs** plugin in minutes

After configuring the connector, refer to our installation documentation for more details on completing the setup.
