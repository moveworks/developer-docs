description: "A plugin that allows IT administrators to retire device records in Jamf\
  \ Pro via the Moveworks AI Assistant. This automation safely marks devices as \u201C\
  Retired\u201D instead of permanently deleting them, ensuring historical and compliance\
  \ data is preserved. Admins can retire devices by name, ID, model, user, department,\
  \ location, lifecycle status, or last check-in date \u2014 helping maintain an accurate\
  \ and clean inventory without destructive actions."
