## **Installation Steps**

We recommend setting up **ServiceNow** before installing this plugin. Please follow the [ServiceNow Connector](https://marketplace.moveworks.com/connectors/servicenow?hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) guide to configure the connection.

For this plugin, ensure the user has the following permissions:

**Table Access**:

- `Read` access to the `sys_user` and `sys_user_group` tables (to identify the assignment group).
- `Read` access to the `incident` table (to retrieve incident details).

Once the connector is successfully configured, follow our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for detailed steps on how to install and activate the plugin in **Agent Studio**.

## **Appendix**

--header 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
--header 'Accept: application/json'
```

**Query Parameters:**

- `USER_EMAIL`(string) –  Email address of the user to retrieve `group_id`.
- `sysparm_fields` (string) – Fields to include in the response
- `sysparm_display_value` (string) – If set to `all`, returns both display values and actual values for each field.

### **API #2: Get Incidents For An Assignment Group**

```bash
curl --location "https://<YOUR_INSTANCE>/api/now/table/incident?sysparm_query=assignment_group={{group_sys_id}}^{{state}}^{{date_range}}&sysparm_fields=number,short_description,priority,category,caller_id,resolved_by,resolved_at,resolution_notes,state,close_notes&sysparm_limit=100&sysparm_display_value=true \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
--header "Accept: application/json"
```

**Query Parameters:**

- `group_sys_id`(string) – The unique ID of the assignment group for which the resolved incidents need to be retrieved.
- `sysparm_fields` (string) – Fields to include in the response.
- `sysparm_limit` (integer) – Maximum number of records to return.
- `state` (optional, integer) – Incident state filter.
- `date_range` – Used to filter incidents within a specified date range, based on their state. The filter applies both the **start date** and **end date.**
