the experience we are going to build.

# **Installation Steps**

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we recommend setting up the connector in **Agent Studio** beforehand to simplify the process. Please follow our [**Workday Connector Guide**](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=workday&hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) for detailed instructions. Once completed, proceed to install the plugin and complete the setup efficiently.

For this plugin, ensure the Workday integration system user has the following permissions:

## **Required Permissions:**

- Get access  to candidate data: **Interview Feedback**
- **View access** to worker data: **Candidate Evaluations**

> Note: Requires "Recruiting" and "Talent" domain permissions in Workday.
> 

**Tenant Configuration:**

All Workday API endpoints in this plugin use **TENANT** as a placeholder. After installation, replace **TENANT** in the action definitions with your actual Workday tenant name.

To find your tenant name:

- Log into Workday.
- Check the URL in your browser — the tenant name appears after `workday.com/`, e.g.: [https://impl.workday.com/**your_tenant**/...](https://impl.workday.com/**your_tenant**/...)
    

Make sure to update this across all actions that reference the Workday API.

After configuring the connector and updating your tenant, refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on completing the setup.

# **Appendix**

### **API #1: Retrieve Interviews**

The **Retrieve Interviews** API retrieves the list of interviews associated with a candidate, based on the provided criteria.

```bash
curl --location 'https://<YOUR_DOMAIN>/api/recruiting/v3/<TENANT>/interviews'\
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>'
```

### **API #2: Fetch Interview Feedback**

The **Fetch Interview Feedback** API allows you to fetch feedback for a specific interview in Workday using the Interview id .

```bash
curl --location 'https://<YOUR_DOMAIN>/ccx/api/recruiting/v4/<TENANT>/interviews/<interview_id>/feedback'\
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>'
```
**Path Parameters:**

- `Interview_id` (string) – The unique identifier of the interview
