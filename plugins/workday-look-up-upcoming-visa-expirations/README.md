# LookUp Upcoming Visa Expirations

## **Introduction**

The **“Look Up Upcoming Visa Expirations”** plugin helps users easily identify employee visas that are set to expire within a specified time frame—directly through the Moveworks AI Assistant. By automatically calculating the expiration window based on the current date and the user-defined range, the plugin retrieves and displays upcoming visa expirations without the need for manual tracking. This proactive approach enhances compliance readiness, streamlines HR operations, and helps avoid last-minute issues related to visa renewals.

This guide will walk you through setting up and customizing the plugin in Agent Studio in just a few minutes. Let’s get started!

## **Prerequisites**

• Access to **Agent Studio**

## **What are we building?**

## **Installation Steps**

We recommend creating the connector for Workday first, prior to installing this plugin. Please follow the  [Workday Connector](https://marketplace.moveworks.com/connectors/workday?hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) guide to set up the connector.

**Note :** For the **Look Up Upcoming Visa Expirations** functionality, make sure your Workday integration system user has the necessary domain permissions.

Specifically, ensure the following domain permissions are assigned with both **View** and **Get** access:

- Passport and Visa Information

**Tenant Configuration:**

All Workday API endpoints in this plugin use `{{TENANT}}` as a placeholder. After installation, replace `{{TENANT}}` in the action definitions with your actual Workday tenant name.

To find your tenant name:

- Log into Workday.
- Check the URL in your browser — the tenant name appears after `workday.com/`, e.g.: [https://impl.workday.com/**your_tenant**/...](https://impl.workday.com/**your_tenant**/...)

Make sure to update this across all actions that reference the Workday API.

After you have configured the connector, Please refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on how to install a plugin in Agent Studio.

## **Appendix:-**
