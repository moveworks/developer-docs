## **Introduction**

The **Check Employee Training Status** plugin empowers managers to view which employees have not completed their required trainings using Workday, all through the Moveworks AI Assistant. This ensures that managers can take timely action to maintain compliance and team readiness without manually digging through reports in Workday.

This guide will walk you through installing and configuring the plugin in **Agent Studio** in just a few minutes. Let’s get started!

## **Prerequisites**

- Access to Agent Studio

## **What are we building?**

### **Agent Design**

## **Installation Steps**

We recommend creating the connector for **Workday** first, prior to installing this plugin. Please follow the [Workday Connector](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=workday&hist=home%2Cbrws#step-4-add-domain-security-policies-to-the-integration-systems-security-group) guide to set up the connector.

Note: For the Check Employee Training Status functionality, make sure your Workday integration system user has the necessary domain permissions.

Specifically, ensure the following domain permissions are assigned with both **View** and **Get** access:

- View and Get access to Learning
- View and Modify access to Required Learning Assignments

Once the connector is configured, refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on how to install a plugin in Agent Studio.
