## **Installation Steps**

We recommend setting up **Salesforce** before installing this plugin. Please follow the [Salesforce Connector](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=salesforce&hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) guide to configure the connection.

Note: To enable the Create a Quote functionality, ensure the Salesforce integration user has the necessary object and field-level permissions.

Specifically, confirm the following permissions are granted:

- **Object Access**: `Create` and `Edit` access to the **Quote** object
- **Field Access**: `Read` and `Edit` access to all required fields used during quote creation.

Once the connector is successfully configured, follow our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for detailed steps on how to install and activate the plugin in **Agent Studio**.
