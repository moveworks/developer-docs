## **Installation Steps**

We recommend creating the connector for **Workday** first, prior to installing this plugin. Please follow the [**Workday Connector**](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=workday&hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) guide to set up the connector.
For this plugin, ensure the Workday integration system user has the following permissions

**Required Permissions:**

- View and Modify access to Person Data: Home Phone

Once the connector is configured, refer to our [**plugin installation documentation**](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on how to install a plugin in Agent Studio.
