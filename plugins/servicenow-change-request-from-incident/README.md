## **Introduction:**

The **Create Change Request from Incident** plugin empowers IT teams to quickly generate a Change Request in ServiceNow directly from an existing Incident record using the Moveworks AI Assistant. This streamlines the change management process by reducing manual effort, improving traceability, and accelerating the resolution of issues that require infrastructure or process modifications.

This guide will walk you through installing and configuring the plugin in Agent Studio in just a few minutes. Let’s get started!

## **Prerequisites:**

- Access to Agent Studio

## **What are we building?**

## **Agent Design**

## **Installation Steps**

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we recommend setting up the connector in **Agent Studio** beforehand to streamline the process. Please follow our **[ServiceNow Connector Guide](https://marketplace.moveworks.com/connectors/servicenow)** for detailed instructions. Once completed, proceed to install the plugin and complete the setup efficiently.

For this plugin, ensure the ServiceNow integration user has the following required permissions:

- **Read** and **Update** access to the **Incident** (`incident`) table – for fetching incident details and linking a Change Request back to the incident
- **Create** access to the **Change Request** (`change_request`) table – for submitting new change requests
- **Read** access to the **Change Model** (`chg_model`) table – for retrieving change model types

After configuring the connector, refer to our [**plugin installation documentation**](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on completing the setup!
