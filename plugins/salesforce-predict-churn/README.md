- Ambient Agent
availability: IDEA
description: When an account's health score drops the agent compiles a risk assessment
  and identifies the top drivers with evidence e.g., “Usage down 35% in last 60 days”
  or “Two P1 incidents unresolved.” The agent then alerts the assigned customer success
  manager with context and proposes proactive actions such as offering a renewal incentive.
  All insights are logged back into the CRM for tracking.
