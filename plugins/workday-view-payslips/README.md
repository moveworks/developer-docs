## **Installation Steps**

We recommend creating the connector for **Workday** first, prior to installing this plugin. Please follow the [Workday Connector](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=workday&hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) guide to set up the connector.

For this plugin, ensure the Workday integration system user has the following permissions:

**Required Permissions:**

- `View and Get access` to Worker Data: Payroll (Payslips)
- `Get access` to Reports: Pay Calculation Results for Worker

**Tenant Configuration:**

All Workday API endpoints in this plugin use **TENANT** as a placeholder. After installation, replace **TENANT** in the action definitions with your actual Workday tenant name.

To find your tenant name:

- Log into Workday.
- Check the URL in your browser — the tenant name appears after `workday.com/`, e.g.: [https://impl.workday.com/**your_tenant**/...](https://impl.workday.com/**your_tenant**/...)
    

Make sure to update this across all actions that reference the Workday API.

After configuring the connector and updating your tenant, refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on completing the setup.
