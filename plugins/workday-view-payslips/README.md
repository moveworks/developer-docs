## **Installation Steps**

We recommend creating the connector for **Workday** first, prior to installing this plugin. Please follow the [Workday Connector](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=workday&hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) guide to set up the connector.

For this plugin, ensure the Workday integration system user has the following permissions:

**Required Permissions:**

- `View access` to Worker Data: Payroll (Payslips)

Once the connector is configured, refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on how to install a plugin in Agent Studio.
