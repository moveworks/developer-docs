## **Installation Steps**

We recommend setting up **ServiceNow** before installing this plugin. Please follow the [ServiceNow Connector](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=servicenow&hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) guide to configure the connection.

Ensure the following permissions are granted:

- **Table Access**: `Read` and `Update` access to the `change_request` table
- **Field Access**: `Read` access to retrieve approved change requests, and `Write` access to update scheduling details

Once the connector is successfully configured, follow our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for detailed steps on how to install and activate the plugin in **Agent Studio**
