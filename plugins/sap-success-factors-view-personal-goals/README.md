## Installation Steps

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we recommend setting up the connector in **Agent Studio** beforehand to streamline the process. Please follow the [SAP SuccessFactors Connector](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=sap-success-factors&hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) Guide to configure the connection.

Note: To enable the View Personal Goals functionality, ensure the SAP SuccessFactors integration user has the necessary permission scopes.

**Required Scope:**

- `View` access to the **Goal Plan** entity

After configuring the connector, refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on completing the setup.
