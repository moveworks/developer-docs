# Installation Steps

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we do recommend that you create a connector in Agent Studio before installing this plugin to streamline the process. Please follow our Zoom **Connector Guide** to do so. Once you have done this, simply follow our plugin installation documentation to get your plugin installed in minutes.

**Scopes Needed:**

- `user:read:user:admin`
- `meeting:read:list_meetings:admin`
- For more information : [https://developers.zoom.us/docs/integrations/oauth-scopes-overview/](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/integrations/oauth-scopes-overview/)

# Appendix

- This API call retrieves a report of Zoom meetings that a specific user, identified by their email address, has participated in within a specified date range.
    
    ```bash
    curl -X GET "https://api.zoom.us/v2/report/users/{{email}}/meetings?from={{from_date}}&to={{to_date}}&type=pastJoined&page_size=300" \
         --header "accept: application/json" \
         --header "authorization: Bearer {{personal_access_token}}" \
         --header "content-type: application/json"
    ```
    
    - Required parameters:
        - **`email`**: The email address of the user whose meetings you want to retrieve. Replace **`{{email}}`** with the actual email address.
        - **`from`**: The start date for the report in **`YYYY-MM-DD`** format, specifying the beginning of the date range. Replace **`{{from_date}}`** with the appropriate start date.
        - **`to`**: The end date for the report in **`YYYY-MM-DD`** format, specifying the end of the date range. Replace **`{{to_date}}`** with the appropriate end date.
        - **`type`**: Set to **`pastJoined`** to filter and retrieve meetings that the user has joined in the past.
        - **`page_size`**: The number of records returned per API call. In this case, it's set to **`300`** to retrieve up to 300 meetings per request.
