# Pre-requisites

Before installing and using the **Approve or Reject** **PTO** plugin, please ensure the following requirements are met:

## **1. UKG Connector**

This plugin requires an active **UKG connector** with **user consent auth** to communicate with your UKG instance.

- If you have not already configured the connector, please follow the **[UKG Connector Guide](https://marketplace.moveworks.com/connectors/ukg)** available in the Moveworks Marketplace.
- The connector must be fully set up before installing this plugin.
- Once the connector is successfully configured, follow our [**plugin installation documentation**](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for detailed steps on how to install and activate the plugin in **Agent Studio**.

**Note:** UKG’s user-consent authorization expires every 24 hours, requiring users to reauthorize once per day. This is a known limitation, and support for handling such short-lived refresh tokens is being built on Moveworks.

## **2. UKG System Requirements**

### **End User Permissions (Manager Persona)**

To approve or reject PTO through this plugin, managers must already have permissions to approve or reject PTO in UKG WFM — the same permissions required to approve or reject PTO through the UKG WFM UI.

At a minimum, end users must have:

- **Time Off permissions** that allow:
    - Viewing available Time Off Types
    - Viewing own Time Off requests
    - Viewing, Approving or Rejecting Time Off requests for direct reports
- Access to their own and **direct reports’ employee profile and time account balances**

**Note**: The plugin does not grant new permissions. It respects existing role-based permissions and policies granted to the user in UKG WFM.

# **Implementation details**

## Visual Representation of How the Plugin Works

## API Details

Before running the cURL examples below, replace `<YOUR_UKG_HOST>` with your actual UKG hostname.

**Admin Checklist: How to Find Your UKG Hostname**

1. Log in to your UKG account.
2. Check the URL in your browser’s address bar.
3. Your hostname will follow one of these formats (examples):
    - `https://acme-dev.cfn.mykronos.com`
    - `https://acme-test.cfn.mykronos.com`
    - `https://acme-uat.cfn.mykronos.com`
    - `https://acme-prod.cfn.mykronos.com`

Use the full hostname (e.g., `acme-prod.cfn.mykronos.com`) when replacing `<YOUR_UKG_HOST>` in the cURL commands.

### **API #1: Get a User’s UKG ID**

This REST API is used to fetch employee details for the current logged in user.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://<YOUR_UKG_HOST>/api/v1/commons/persons/current_user_info?include_contact_information=true' \
  --header 'Authorization: <ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

**Query Parameters:**

- None.

### **API #2: Update PTO Status**

This API is used to **update the status of a PTO request** in UKG WFM as a an authenticated manager user.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://<YOUR_UKG_HOST>/api/v1/scheduling/timeoff/apply_update \
  --header 'Authorization: <ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
  --data '{
    "changeState": {
        "do": {
            "toStatus": {
                "name": "<NEW_STATUS>"
            },
            "commentNotes": [
                {
                    "comment": {
                        "active": true,
                        "name": "Request Comment"
                    },
                    "notes": [
                        {
                            "text": "<COMMENT_TEXT>",
                            "dataSourceDisplayName": "<COMMENTER_USERNAME>"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ]
        },
        "where": {
            "timeOffRequestId": "<PTO_ID>"
        }
    }
}'
```

**Query Parameters:**

- `NEW_STATUS` *(string):* This will be the new status value that needs to be applied to the PTO request and should only be set to “Approved” or “Refused”.
- `COMMENT_TEXT` *(string):* This will be the comment to be added to the PTO request.
- `PTO_ID` *(string):* This will be the PTO Identifier to update.

**Key nuances:**

- `NEW_STATUS` values can only be “Approved” or “Refused”.
- `COMMENT_TEXT` is mandatory if the `NEW_STATUS` is “Refused”.

### API References
