the experience we are going to build.

## **Installation Steps**

We recommend using user consent auth (authorization grant type). This plugin was made with APIs using authorization code grant type flow. You'll find the required permissions for User consent auth under the 'Required Salesforce Permissions'.

**User Consent Authentication Benefits:**

With OAuth 2.0 User Consent Authentication enabled, users can securely access their own Salesforce data—such as opportunities, tasks, activities, notes, and related records—through Moveworks without sharing credentials. By authenticating once through Salesforce’s login page, each user allows the bot to securely access and retrieve opportunity details on their behalf.

This ensures data privacy, role-based access control, and a seamless self-service experience where users only see the data they are authorized to view.

**Required Salesforce Permissions:**

To enable access to the Salesforce API endpoints used in this plugin, ensure your Salesforce connected app has the correct OAuth scope configured under:

- **Setup → App Manager → Connected Apps → [Your Connected App]**

**Required OAuth Scope:**

- **Access and manage your data (api)**

This scope is essential for retrieving Opportunities, Opportunity History, Tasks, Events, Notes, and related records via Salesforce REST APIs.

Ensure the integration user (via profile or permission sets) has **read and edit access** to:

- **Opportunity** – Required for retrieving opportunity details and updating the Next Step field.

These permissions are necessary to fetch opportunity information and enable accurate Next Step updates within the plugin.

**Your Instance Configuration:**

All Salesforce API endpoints in this plugin use `{{YOUR_INSTANCE_DOMAIN}}` as a placeholder.

Follow the steps below to update it correctly after installation:

1. Go to your **Salesforce Setup**.
2. In the **Quick Find** box, search for **My Domain** and select it.
3. Locate your **Salesforce org’s My Domain URL** (e.g., `yourcompany.my.salesforce.com`).
4. Replace `{{YOUR_INSTANCE_DOMAIN}}` with your actual My Domain URL in all **action definitions** within the connector.
5. Ensure all API requests use **HTTPS** and leverage **OAuth 2.0 authentication**.
6. Save your configuration to ensure that all API requests are routed correctly and securely to your Salesforce instance

After configuring the connector, refer to our [**plugin installation documentation**](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for details on installing the plugin in Agent Studio.

### **API #1: Search Opportunities by Criteria**

```bash
curl --location 'https://arbaan-dev-ed.my.salesforce.com/services/data/v64.0/query/?q=SELECT+Id%2C+Name%2C+StageName%2C+Amount%2C+CloseDate%2C+LastActivityDate%2C+LastModifiedDate%2C+CreatedDate%2C+NextStep%2C+Owner.Id%2C+Owner.Name%2C+Owner.Email%2C+Account.Id%2C+Account.Name%2C+Type%2C+LeadSource%2C+Description+FROM+Opportunity+WHERE+{{{filter_query}}}+ORDER+BY+CreatedDate+ASC+LIMIT+200' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

**Query Parameters**

- **`filter_query`** — A dynamic **SOQL WHERE filter** built based on the user’s search input.

- **`limit`** — Maximum number of records to return.
- **`fields`** — Comma-separated list of Opportunity fields to return:
    
    `Id, Name, StageName, Amount, CloseDate, LastActivityDate, LastModifiedDate, CreatedDate, NextStep, Owner.Id, Owner.Name, Owner.Email, Account.Id, Account.Name, Type, LeadSource, Description`.
    

**RSQL Filtering Notes**

- Use **SOQL syntax** in the `filter_query` parameter to filter opportunities based on different criteria.
- Common examples:
    - **Opportunity Name:** `Name LIKE '%{{opportunity_name}}%'`
    - **Account Name:** `Account.Name LIKE '%{{account_name}}%'`
    - **Owner Email:** `Owner.Email = '{{owner.email}}`
    - **Stage Name:** `StageName LIKE '%{{stage_name}}%'`
    - **Close Date Range:** `CloseDate >= {{from_date}} AND CloseDate <= {{to_date}}`
- Filters can be **combined** using:
    - `AND` → both conditions must be true
    - `OR` → either condition can be true

**Example of a Compound Filter Query:**

```bash
Account.Name LIKE '%{{account_name}}%'
```

**Example Response:**

```bash
{
  "totalCount": 1,
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "{{opportunity_id}}",
      "general": {
        "name": "{{opportunity_name}}",
        "amount": "{{amount}}",
        "stageName": "{{stage_name}}",
        "closeDate": "{{close_date}}",
        "lastActivityDate": "{{last_activity_date}}",
        "lastModifiedDate": "{{last_modified_date}}",
        "createdDate": "{{created_date}}",
        "nextStep": "{{next_step}}",
        "type": "{{opportunity_type}}",
        "leadSource": "{{lead_source}}",
        "description": "{{description}}"
      },
      "owner": {
        "id": "{{owner_id}}",
        "name": "{{owner_name}}",
        "email": "{{owner_email}}"
      },
      "account": {
        "id": "{{account_id}}",
        "name": "{{account_name}}"
      }
    }
  ]
}

```
