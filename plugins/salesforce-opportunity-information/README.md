# **Installation Steps**

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we recommend creating a connector in **Agent Studio** beforehand to streamline the process. Please follow our [Salesforce Connector](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=salesforce&hist=home) Guide to do so. Once completed, follow our plugin installation documentation to install the **Lookup Opportunity Information** plugin in minutes.

## **Required Permissions:**

- **Read**
    - Access to the **Opportunity** object.
    - Access to custom fields used in opportunity reporting.
    

After configuring the connector, refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on completing the setup

# **Appendix**

## API #1:Query the Opportunity by Account Name:

The Retrieve Opportunity information by account name API retrieves Opportunity details for a given **Account Name** from Salesforce using a SOQL query. This API helps in accessing Opportunity information associated with specific Salesforce accounts.

```bash
curl --location 'https://<YOUR_DOMAIN>//services/data/v62.0/query?q=SELECT%20AccountId%2C%20Amount%2C%20StageName%2C%20CloseDate%2C%20Id%20FROM%20Opportunity%20WHERE%[20Account.Name](http://20account.name/)%20like%20ABC1%20ORDER%20BY%20CloseDate%20DESC%20LIMIT%201' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

**Query Parameters:**

- Account_Name(string) – The name of the Account to search for related contracts in Salesforce.
