# **Installation Steps**

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we recommend creating a connector in **Agent Studio** beforehand to streamline the process. Please follow our [Salesforce Connector](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=salesforce&hist=home) Guide to do so. Once completed, follow our plugin installation documentation to install the **Create Account** plugin in minutes.

## **Required Permissions:**

- **Read**
    - Access to the **Account** object
- **Edit**
    - Ability to modify **Account** fields post-creation

After configuring the connector, refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on completing the setup

# **Appendix**

## API #1: Create Account.

The Create Account API is used to create a account in salesforce. 

```bash
curl --location 'https://<YOUR_DOMAIN>/services/data/v62.0/sobjects/Account/' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
"Name" : ":<Account_Name>",

"BillingCity": "<Billing_City>",
"BillingState": "<Billing_state>",
"BillingCountry": "<BillingCountry>"
}'
```
