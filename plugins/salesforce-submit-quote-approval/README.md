This eliminates manual workflows, accelerates deal cycles, and ensures compliance with approval policies—all within a conversational interface.

This guide outlines the quick setup to activate quote approvals in minutes.

# **Prerequisites :**

- Access to Agent Studio

# **Installation Steps**

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we recommend creating a connector in **Agent Studio** beforehand to streamline the process. Please follow our [Salesforce Connector](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=salesforce&hist=home) Guide to do so. Once completed, follow our plugin installation documentation to install the **Lookup Opportunity Information** plugin in minutes.

## **Required Permissions:**

- **Read & Create**
    - Access to **Quote**, **Opportunity**, and **Approval Process** objects
    - Visibility to quote line items and pricing fields

After configuring the connector, refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on completing the setup

# **Appendix**

## **API #1: Retrieve Quote Number Based on Account Name**

The Retrieve Quote Number Based on Account Name API retrieves the **Quote Numbers** associated with a given **Account Name** from Salesforce using a SOQL query. This API helps in identifying and retrieving the quote numbers linked to specific Salesforce accounts.

```bash
curl --location 'https://<YOUR_DOMAIN>/services/data/v62.0/query/?q=SELECT+Id,+Name,+Discount,+QuoteNumber,+CreatedDate,+Status,+ExpirationDate,+TotalPrice,+AccountId+FROM+Quote+WHERE+Account.Name+LIKE+%27%25<ACCOUNT_NAME>%25%27' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>'
```

**Query Parameters:**

- Account_Name(string) – The name of the Account to search for related contracts in Salesforce.

## **API #2: Process Approval**

The **Process Approval** API allows you to submit a quote (or any other record) for approval in Salesforce. 

```bash
curl --location 'https://<YOUR_DOMAIN>/services/data/v63.0/process/approvals/' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
"requests": [
{
"actionType": "Submit",
"contextId": "<QUOTE_ID>",
"comments": "<COMMENTS>",
"contextActorId": "<CONTEXT_ACTOR_ID>",
"skipEntryCriteria": "<TRUE_OR_FALSE>"
}
]
}'
```
