# **Installation Steps**

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we recommend setting up the connector in **Agent Studio** beforehand to streamline the process. Please follow our [**Salesforce Connector Guide**](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=salesforce&hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) for detailed instructions. Once completed, proceed to install the plugin and complete the setup efficiently.

For this plugin, ensure the Salesforce integration user has the following permissions:

- `Read` access to the **Account** object
- `Read` access to the **Opportunity** object

After configuring the connector, refer to our **[plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation)** for more details on completing the setup!
