## Introduction

The “**Create a Draft Knowledge Article”** plugin enables users to quickly generate draft knowledge articles from resolved **Incidents**, **Problems**, and **Change Requests**, or **start a plain draft from scratch** in ServiceNow using the Moveworks AI Assistant. This streamlines the process by leveraging existing resolution data, reducing manual effort, and promoting knowledge reuse across the organization.

This guide will walk you through installing and configuring the plugin in **Agent Studio** in just a few minutes. Let’s get started!

## **Prerequisites**

- Access to Agent Studio

shows the experience we are going to build.

## **Installation Steps**

We recommend setting up **ServiceNow** before installing this plugin. Please follow the [ServiceNow Connector](https://marketplace.moveworks.com/connectors/servicenow?hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) guide to configure the connection.

Ensure the following permissions are granted:

- **Table Access**:
    - `Read` access to the `incident`, `problem`, and `change_request` tables to fetch resolved records.
    - `Write` access to the `kb_knowledge` table to create and update draft knowledge articles.
    - `m2m_kb_task` – Write access to link knowledge articles to tasks (Incidents, Problems, or Change Requests).
- **Field Access**:
    - `Read` access to resolution notes, short descriptions, and other relevant metadata fields in the `incident`, `problem`, and `change_request` tables.
    - `Write` access to populate and edit fields in knowledge articles.

Once the connector is successfully configured, follow our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for detailed steps on how to install and activate the plugin in **Agent Studio**!
