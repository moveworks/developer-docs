This guide will walk you through installing and configuring the plugin in **Agent Studio** in just a few minutes. Let’s get started!

## **Prerequisites**

- Access to Agent Studio

## Installation Steps

While you can create a connector during plugin installation, we recommend setting up the connector in **Agent Studio** beforehand to streamline the process. Please follow our [**Workday Connector Guide**](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=workday&hist=home%2Cbrws#how-to-implement) for detailed instructions. Once completed, proceed to install the plugin and complete the setup efficiently.

For this plugin, ensure the Workday integration system user has the following permissions:

**Required Permissions:**

- **View access** to Worker Profile

**Tenant Configuration:**

All Workday API endpoints in this plugin use **`TENANT`** as a placeholder. After installation, replace **`TENANT`** in the action definitions with your actual Workday tenant name.

To find your tenant name:

- Log into Workday.
- Check the URL in your browser — the tenant name appears after `workday.com/`, e.g.: [https://impl.workday.com/**your_tenant**/...](https://impl.workday.com/**your_tenant**/...)
    

Make sure to update this across all actions that reference the Workday API.

**TAB TASK ID Configuration:**

This **TAB TASK ID** refers to the employee's **'Pay'** worklet, where they can access their **Tax Documents**.

To ensure the plugin provides the correct URL that opens the employee’s **Tax Documents** tab in Workday, follow the configuration steps below:

- Open the **Worker Summary** page for the user.

-  Click the **'Pay'** worklet under the **Worker Profile**.

-  Select **'Tax Documents'** to access the tax forms.

-  **Get the TAB TASK ID** from the URL or interface element.

-  **In your plugin’s content activity, remove the placeholder `{{tab_task_id}}` and replace it with your TAB TASK ID** (towards the end of your deep link).

After configuring the connector and updating your tenant, refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on completing the setup.
