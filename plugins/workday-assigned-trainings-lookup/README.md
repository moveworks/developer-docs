## **Installation Steps**

We recommend creating the connector for **Workday** first, before installing this plugin. Please follow the [Workday Connector](https://developer.moveworks.com/marketplace/package/?id=workday&hist=home%2Cbrws#step-4-add-domain-security-policies-to-the-integration-systems-security-group) guide to set up the connector.

Note: For the Look Up Assigned Trainings functionality, ensure your Workday integration system user has the necessary domain permissions.

Specifically, ensure the following domain permissions are assigned with both **View** and **Get** access:

- Worker Profile
- Required Learning Assignments

**Tenant Configuration:**

All Workday API endpoints in this plugin use `<TENANT>` as a placeholder. After installation, replace `<TENANT>` in the action definitions with your actual Workday tenant name.

To find your tenant name:

- Log into Workday.
- Check the URL in your browser — the tenant name appears after `workday.com/`, e.g.: [https://impl.workday.com/**your_tenant**/...](https://impl.workday.com/**your_tenant**/...)

Make sure to update this across all actions that reference the Workday API.

After configuring the connector and updating your tenant, refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more details on completing the setup.

  "query": "SELECT enrolledContent as Course, learner, registrationStatus, completionStatus, learningAssignment{dueDate1} as learningAssignment FROM learningEnrollments WHERE  completionStatus =  \"{{status_id}}\" AND learner = \"{{worker_id}}\""
}'

```

**Query Parameters:**

- `worker_id` (string) – Filter learning enrollments for a specific learner or worker ID
