# Installation Steps

We recommend creating the connector for Greenhouse first, prior to installing this plugin. Please follow the [Greenhouse Connector](https://developer.moveworks.com/creator-studio/resources/connector?id=greenhouse) guide to create the connector.

After you have configured the connector, please refer to our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace) for more information on how to install a plugin.

# Customization Options

For approval-related actions, update the **redirectional link** in the `instructions_for_model` block of the compound action script. Replace `YOUR_DOMAIN` in the link `https://YOUR_DOMAIN/approvals` with your organization's domain URL.

# Appendix

### API #1: Fetch User Id

The [List Users](https://developers.greenhouse.io/harvest.html?shell#get-list-users) API in Greenhouse allows you to retrieve details about users within the system. The API response will be used to extract the `user_id`, which will then be used to ensure that candidate applications are only shown for jobs the user has permission to access.

```bash
curl 'https://harvest.greenhouse.io/v1/users?email={{user.email_addr}}'
--user '<api_key>:'
```

**Query Parameters :**

- Key ( **email** ) : Value ( **{{user.email_addr}}** )

### API #2: Fetch Pending Approvals

The [Pending Approvals for User](https://developers.greenhouse.io/harvest.html?shell#get-pending-approvals-for-user) API in Greenhouse allows you to retrieve a list of pending job requisitions awaiting approval for a specific user. 

```bash
curl 'https://harvest.greenhouse.io/v1/users/{user_id}/pending_approvals'
--user '<api_key>:'
```

### API #3: Fetch Job Details

The [Retrieve Job](https://developers.greenhouse.io/harvest.html?shell#get-retrieve-job) API in Greenhouse allows you to retrieve detailed information about a specific job. 

```bash
curl 'https://harvest.greenhouse.io/v1/jobs/{id}'
--user '<api_key>:'
```
