## **Introduction:-**

The **“Look Up My Assignment Group's Members”** capability enables users to effortlessly view the members of their assignment group in ServiceNow through the Moveworks AI Assistant. By identifying the user's group association, the assistant retrieves and displays a real-time list of group members. This reduces dependency on manual lookups, promotes team visibility, and streamlines collaboration across IT support teams for faster issue resolution.

This guide will walk you through installing and configuring the plugin in **Agent Studio** in just a few minutes. Let’s get started!
