# Built-in Connector

This connector is built into our product. You can configure it in Moveworks Setup. Please see our [help documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/) for instructions!

If you want to call Moveworks from Freshservice, we recommend using Freshservice Automator's webhooks: https://support.freshservice.com/support/solutions/articles/157143-using-webhooks-with-the-workflow-automator
