# **Installation Steps**

We recommend creating the connector for Salesforce first, prior to installing this plugin. Please follow the [**Salesforce Connector**](https://marketplace.moveworks.com/creator-studio/resources/connector/?id=salesforce) guide to create the connector.

After you have configured the connector, please refer to our [**plugin installation documentation**](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for more information on how to install a plugin.

# **Appendix**

### **API #1: Salesforce SOQL Query API**

An API for Salesforce to execute the specified SOQL Query. Here, our query would be related to the **`Campaign`** object. The below API gives a list of campaigns matching particular keywords given as the input. Here is an example of a sample query API using a SOQL query on the Account object. 

```bash
curl --location 'https://<YOUR_DOMAIN>/services/data/v62.0/query?q=SELECT%20Id%2C%20CreatedDate%2C%20Name%20FROM%20Campaign%20WHERE%20Name%20LIKE%20%27%25Q4%Campaign%2025%25%27%20ORDER%20BY%20CreatedDate%20DESC' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'

Copy
```

**Query Parameters :**

- Key ( **q** ) : Value ( **{{SELECT Id, CreatedDate, Name FROM Campaign WHERE Name LIKE '%Q4%Campaign%2025%' ORDER BY CreatedDate DESC}}** )

The Query we used here is:

```bash
SELECT Id, CreatedDate, Name FROM Campaign WHERE Name LIKE '%Q4%Campaign%2025%' ORDER BY CreatedDate DESC

Copy
```

You can pass multiple keywords with spaces to the `LIKE` operator to search for objects that contain all of those keywords. 

**For example**, to search for a campaign named "Q4 Campaigns 2025", you can use the SOQL query with `'%Q4%Campaigns%2025%'`. The query will then look for records that have "Q4," "Campaigns," and "2025" in any order, with any characters in between.

### **API #2: Salesforce SOQL Query API**

An API for Salesforce to execute the specified SOQL Query. Here, our query would be related to the **`CampaignMember`** object to fetch leads for a given **`campaignId`**. Here is an example of a sample query API using a SOQL query on the Account object.

```jsx
curl --location 'https://<YOUR_DOMAIN>/services/data/v64.0/query?q=SELECT%20Lead.Owner.Email%2C%20Record_Type__c%2C%20LeadId%2C%20Lead.FirstName%2C%20Lead.LastName%2C%20Lead.Email%2C%20Lead.Company%2C%20Lead.Status%20FROM%20CampaignMember%20WHERE%20CampaignId%20%3D%20%27601Ed00000KQay1IAD%27%20AND%20LeadId%20%21%3D%20NULL%20AND%20Record_Type__c%3D%27Lead%27%20LIMIT%202000' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'

Copy
```

**Query Parameters :**

- Key ( **q** ) : Value ( **{{SELECT Lead.Owner.Email, Record_Type__c, LeadId, Lead.FirstName, Lead.LastName, Lead.Email, Lead.Company, Lead.Status FROM CampaignMember WHERE CampaignId = '601Ed00000KQay1IAD' AND LeadId != NULL AND Record_Type__c='Lead'}}** )

The Query we used here is:

```bash
SELECT Record_Type__c, LeadId, Lead.FirstName, Lead.LastName, Lead.Email, Lead.Company, Lead.Status FROM CampaignMember WHERE CampaignId = '601Ed00000KQay1IAD' AND LeadId != NULL AND Record_Type__c='Lead' LIMIT 2000
Copy
```

In the above example, we have used only Standard Salesforce objects, however, you can also use the [**Custom**](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.basics_object_types.htm&type=5) objects that is defined in your Salesforce instance to build the Query. Custom objects can be identified by the trailing __c after their name. You can visit [**https://workbench.developerforce.com**](https://workbench.developerforce.com/) and explore the different fields present within the Lead/Campaign object. You can also try out different SOQL queries and use the one which you think is a best fit for the Use Case.
